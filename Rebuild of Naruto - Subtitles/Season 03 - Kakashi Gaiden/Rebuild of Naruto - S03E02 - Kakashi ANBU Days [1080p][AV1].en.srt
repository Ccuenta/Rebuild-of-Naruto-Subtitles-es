00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>Kakashi...</i>

2
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:51,821
It won't wash off!

3
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,422
A message from the Hokage!

4
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,537
Deliver it to Lord Tsuchikage

5
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:25,689
and tell him that we require
an immediate response!

6
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,670
There's no need to deliver
anything to him.

7
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,547
We'll give you your answer
right here!

8
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,695
Sometimes it's best not
to be so hasty.

9
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:53,203
What?!

10
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,199
The Fourth Kazekage?

11
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,576
Why is the Hidden Sand here?

12
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:06,115
This is Hidden Sand territory.

13
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:08,990
It would be unwise to have
an incident occur here.

14
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,757
We will extinguish any sparks
that fall on us.

15
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,738
The Sand will will act as it sees fit.

16
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,307
Remember that,
whatever you decide to do.

17
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:26,879
Scatter!

18
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,747
What of the peace treaty proposal?

19
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:39,689
Naturally, it will be turned down.

20
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,392
Whatever the Hidden Leaf negotiates
with the Hidden Sand,

21
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,921
nothing will shake the unity of the Stone.

22
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,228
– Right!
– Exactly!

23
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,573
Silence!

24
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,794
Naturally, I am proud of
the unity of the Stone.

25
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,571
However...

26
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:05,143
With our pride on the line,
we sent 1000 of our shinobi.

27
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,826
And I hear that one man, the Yellow Flash,
was all it took to stop them.

28
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:14,115
And that's the reality of it.

29
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,805
I hear they're going to enter
into a peace treaty

30
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,415
with the Hidden Stone.

31
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,014
How much faith can we put
in a single piece of paper?

32
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,377
That's for sure.

33
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,275
Think about the burden on Lord Third!

34
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:41,314
In any case, this long Great War
will finally be over.

35
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:42,921
Let's toast with some dumplings!

36
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,276
Hey, Kakashi!

37
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,701
Want to join us for some dumplings?

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,723
He hasn't been very sociable lately.

39
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,789
Is something bothering him?

40
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:17,358
Well, you can't expect him
to be jumping for joy.

41
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,952
Are you talking about
Obito and Rin?

42
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,222
Yeah.

43
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,810
That would definitely leave
a hole in your heart...

44
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:37,807
<i>Kakashi...</i>

45
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,613
<i>Rin...</i>

46
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,023
Well done!

47
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,656
We can breathe
a sigh of relief for a while.

48
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,850
Are you satisfied with
an agreement like this?

49
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,418
To forgive
the Hidden Stone's actions

50
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,154
and drop our demands
for compensation...

51
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,665
It's as though we lost the war!

52
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,494
What do you think, Hiruzen?

53
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,932
Continuing the war
any further would be disastrous

54
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,376
for the already
exhausted Hidden Leaf.

55
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,095
It's a step toward finding
common ground...

56
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:43,550
Many of my comrades gave their lives
in this Great War!

57
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,827
It's like they died in vain!

58
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,803
And I assume full responsibility
for that.

59
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,731
How will you take responsibility?

60
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:04,003
I intend to step down as the Third Hokage
and name the Fourth.

61
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,956
How regrettable...

62
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,595
The Third Hokage was doing a fine job...

63
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
Hmm...

64
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,321
Truth be told, the Third was too soft...

65
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,723
and he allowed the village
to be pushed into a corner.

66
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:32,058
We need a Hokage
who will change things,

67
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,711
and enforce the laws of the shinobi.

68
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:36,116
We need someone like that.

69
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:39,218
And? Is there such a person?

70
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:46,798
I recommend Orochimaru,
one of the Legendary Sannin.

71
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,408
– Oh...
– Him?

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,452
What do you think, Lord Third?

73
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:59,884
Orochimaru is a once-in-a-generation genius.

74
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,039
However...

75
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:08,972
A dark ambition lurks behind those eyes.

76
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,061
Such a person cannot be given
the duties of a Hokage.

77
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,087
Lord Third!

78
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,723
I recommend Minato Namikaze.

79
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,709
A pupil of Jiraiya...

80
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,295
In other words, your own student's student.

81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,781
A man so skilled,
he's nicknamed the Yellow Flash.

82
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,324
Oh!

83
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,012
Minato is still too young.

84
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,077
He emerged victorious
at the Battle of Kannabi Bridge,

85
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:41,734
and distinguished himself

86
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,411
by leading us to victory in
the Third Great Ninja War.

87
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,378
I am opposed!

88
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,694
What about the rest of you?

89
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,461
I believe that you will carry on
the Will of Fire.

90
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,173
I want to entrust you with
the future of the Hidden Leaf...

91
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,757
and the shinobi world.

92
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,845
You will accept, won't you?

93
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,919
I shall do my best to deserve
your trust, Lord Third.

94
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:44,358
I wish I could have passed this on
under better circumstances...

95
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,111
What lies ahead is not peaceful.

96
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,588
I'm prepared for it.

97
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,115
Good.

98
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,162
I know you can do it.

99
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,474
What are you doing there?

100
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,657
What did Lord Third want with you?

101
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,126
Well...

102
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:27,477
Did you get scolded?

103
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:31,191
So what if you did?
Don't worry about it, ya know!

104
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,926
Well, it wasn't that...

105
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,936
Then what?

106
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:37,871
Well...

107
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,817
He wants me to be
the Fourth Hokage.

108
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:44,679
Oh really?
Don't mind the Hokage...

109
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,668
What?! What did you just say?

110
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,718
I've been named the Fourth Hokage.

111
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,421
Congratulations, ya know!

112
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,267
Hey, hey...

113
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,463
Thank you very much for
all your hard work.

114
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,358
Thank you.

115
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:25,506
This is all going according
to Hiruzen's plan.

116
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:29,265
The Third Hokage intends to
use Minato as a puppet

117
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,543
and keep ruling the Hidden Leaf.

118
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:35,829
At this rate, the Hidden Leaf
has no future.

119
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,713
Don't give up yet.

120
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,240
If my research is successful,

121
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,227
it will be easy to grasp
the power of the Hidden Leaf.

122
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:52,753
To grasp power...
stronger measures must be prepared.

123
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,037
When the time comes, we won't be
picky about the means.

124
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:59,600
But, it's not time yet.

125
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,040
Generally, if he's popular at all,
he should...

126
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:13,328
Let's go, Kinoe, Kinoto, Hinoe!

127
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:14,566
– Sir!
– Sir!

128
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,187
What's going on?!

129
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:36,390
Hey, Kakashi!

130
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,463
"How a Shinobi Should Die"?!

131
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:42,527
What is this?

132
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,762
Give it back.

133
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:45,756
What's going on?

134
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,348
Oh yeah!

135
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,959
The Fourth Hokage
was just announced!

136
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,271
Don't be shocked!

137
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,592
Minato-sensei will be
the Fourth Hokage!

138
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:05,993
Rin...

139
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:11,693
It seems like Minato-sensei
is going to be Hokage!

140
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,001
Minato-sensei will be
the Professor's successor

141
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:20,783
and change the Hidden Leaf...
and the shinobi world.

142
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,509
There won't be any more sacrifices
like you...

143
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,856
I'm counting on you...
Fourth Hokage.

144
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,128
I shall dedicate my life to it.

145
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,048
Enter.

146
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:19,816
There's a mission?

147
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:24,871
Yes, I want you to retrieve the documents
relating to the peace treaty.

148
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,234
Yes.

149
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:30,984
There are still some shinobi
who desire war.

150
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,047
And there are rumors that they are trying
to steal the documents to create discord.

151
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,706
Please do your best on this mission.

152
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,237
Yes, sir.

153
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,921
I'll wrap this up!

154
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:00,558
<i>Chidori!</i>

155
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,298
<i>Kakashi...</i>

156
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:04,755
<i>Kakashi...</i>

157
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:07,875
<i>Kakashi...</i>

158
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>Kakashi!</i>

159
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,761
Die!

160
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,628
<i>Severe Leaf Hurricane!</i>

161
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,178
<i>Another one?</i>

162
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,835
This isn't like you!
Your head's in the clouds!

163
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,755
S-Sorry...

164
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:43,117
Kakashi?

165
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,712
Get a hold of yourself!

166
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,565
I see...

167
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,045
Yes...

168
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,145
I've never seen Kakashi like that.

169
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:10,081
I'm glad I secretly sent you.

170
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:15,421
To help him at a time like this...
That's what an eternal rival is for!

171
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,592
That's what I believe, but...

172
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,551
You've already done a lot.

173
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,929
Will you leave the rest to me?

174
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,822
Minato-sensei! I mean... Lord Fourth...

175
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,568
Address me as you always have.

176
00:15:55,287 --> 00:16:01,710
Some in the village think I'm not qualified
for the position and oppose me.

177
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,577
I came here today...

178
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:11,535
to assign you to the ANBU
under my direct control.

179
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:16,615
Why me?

180
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,836
I want you to be my right-hand man...

181
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,336
Here's a set of gear for you.

182
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,918
Thank you.

183
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:29,324
Many shinobi from small villages
that survived

184
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,309
by taking advantage
of the turbulent situation,

185
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:36,762
have no wish to be controlled by
the nations of Fire, Wind and Earth.

186
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:41,130
There's no doubt they will continue
to cause disruptions.

187
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,126
But we must maintain peace,

188
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:47,070
which was attained through
the sacrifice of many.

189
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:51,597
I'm counting on all of you.

190
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

191
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:30,598
<i>Chidori!</i>

192
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:58,071
Huh?

193
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,076
Five shinobi,
all approaching rapidly!

194
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:06,650
What does their headband show?

195
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,856
The Hidden Stone.

196
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,457
We have a peace treaty
with them, don't we?

197
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,569
Maybe they have urgent business?

198
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:15,596
What?!

199
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:22,604
Why are you breaking the treaty?!

200
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,569
We're from the Leaf Village!

201
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,811
You must be making a mistake!

202
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,220
Reinforcements! Withdraw!

203
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,922
Thanks for saving us!
The Hidden Stone betrayed us!

204
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,282
This isn't a Hidden Stone shuriken.

205
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,682
So they were fakes? But why?

206
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,526
They want to cause a rift between
the Stone and the Leaf.

207
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
H-Hey!

208
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,659
Don't chase them too far!

209
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:03,900
<i>Chidori!</i>

210
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,449
Hey! How have you been?

211
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:22,874
Are you ignoring me?!

212
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:29,828
It's only been a short while since
Kakashi transferred into the ANBU,

213
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,435
but some of his actions
are quite astonishing.

214
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:39,315
<i>One...</i>

215
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:48,735
<i>Four!</i>

216
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
Sharingan!

217
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,044
So you're the one they call
Cold-Blooded Kakashi!

218
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,208
Wait, Kakashi!

219
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,187
Help me!

220
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:12,213
Five!

221
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,783
All five were killed with a single blow
to their vital points.

222
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:28,419
If you had kept at least one alive,
we could've gotten some intel...

223
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:35,686
Lord Hokage, regarding the issue
that you were concerned about...

224
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,023
We have not seen any evidence of
psychological trauma in Kakashi

225
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,631
associated with taking Rin's life.

226
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,236
Is something on your mind?

227
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,053
No...

228
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:58,632
Congratulations.

229
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,788
What?

230
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,132
Your due date is... let's see...

231
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,491
October 10.

232
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:09,589
Really?!

233
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:12,863
Huh? A baby...?

234
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:16,722
I'm going to be a mother, ya know!

235
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,291
And I'm going to be a father...

236
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,501
A mother, ya know!

237
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,127
I'm going to be a father!

238
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,472
A mother, ya know!

239
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,380
Imagine that,
I'm going to be a father!

240
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,397
A mother, ya know!

241
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,574
Kakashi, I want you to leave
your current mission

242
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:49,365
and take on a special mission.

243
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:50,506
Was there an issue?

244
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,497
It's nothing like that.

245
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:56,322
It's more like a top-secret errand.

246
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,191
Kushina's pregnant!

247
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,217
Oh... Congratulations.

248
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,766
Thank you.

249
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,638
And so... it will be roughly
nine months until she gives birth.

250
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:12,576
I want you to guard Kushina
against any incidents.

251
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,023
Yes, sir!

252
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,944
Thank you for protecting Kushina.

253
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,910
But...

254
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:10,898
It's standard for the ANBU
directly under Lord Third

255
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:14,260
to take over the guard
during the birthing period.

256
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,039
Then I'll be returning to
my duties in ANBU.

257
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:21,188
There's no need to be so hasty.

258
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,746
Why don't you take
a break for a while?

259
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:41,561
I'm sorry I haven't been by.

260
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,000
It's not that I've forgotten...

261
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:50,345
I've been... sworn to secrecy...

262
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:53,630
but Minato-sensei is going
to be a father.

263
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,336
This generation won't know war.

264
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:00,969
If only we were born a little later...

265
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,411
I should tell Obito too.

266
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:11,289
So I'll be going, Rin.

267
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,401
Thank you!

268
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,098
Thanks, I'll come again.

269
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,926
Hey! Watch where you're walking.

270
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,013
Why don't we just do
Rock-Paper-Scissors again tonight?

271
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:33,817
Not that again!
Think of something more exciting!

272
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:35,510
How can you call yourself my rival?!

273
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:37,802
We have an early start tomorrow.

274
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,494
So let's pass for tonight.

275
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,973
Don't use a mission
as an excuse!

276
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,935
I have all this hot pent-up
energy inside me!

277
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,797
Now is the time for
diligent training!

278
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,858
Honest-to-goodness discipline
and hard work

279
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:54,084
lead to success in future missions!

280
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,012
Are you listening to me?!

281
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,883
You've grown so cold since joining the ANBU.

282
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:02,297
I've heard the rumors. That they're calling
you "Cold-Blooded Kakashi."

283
00:26:04,492 --> 00:26:06,998
Well, I know that
I'm not supposed to talk

284
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,858
about your being in the ANBU.

285
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:12,787
Still, that's no reason to forget
about our friendship!

286
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:13,922
Youth is short!

287
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,948
Say, Guy...

288
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:17,705
Do you sense anything weird?

289
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:20,992
There's a chill in the air...

290
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:24,056
It's your attitude that's causing it!

291
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,477
There's nothing like
the present for youth!

292
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:46,388
That's...!

293
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,847
N-No way...

294
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,282
The Nine-Tails!

295
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:59,227
– Run! Help!
– It's the Nine-Tails!

296
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,781
Lord Third! The Nine-Tails!

297
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:24,481
The Nine-Tails has suddenly
appeared in the Village!

298
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,813
I'm aware of that!

299
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:28,788
I will hold it back.

300
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:31,650
You and the others,
protect the civilians!

301
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,002
Yes, sir!

302
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:38,798
You should have ordered the Uchiha
Police Force to guard the civilians

303
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,798
and kept them in the rear.

304
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:45,824
We should use the visual prowess of the
Uchiha to suppress the Nine-Tails!

305
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,786
They can also manipulate
the Nine-Tails!

306
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:53,605
If they take control of the Nine-Tails,
and use it to their advantage,

307
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:57,712
it will be like the second coming
of Madara Uchiha.

308
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,700
I will leave you to
protect the civilians.

309
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,079
Order the ANBU and
security units as you wish.

310
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:12,545
Guard the village youth as well.

311
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:13,769
Understood.

312
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:17,879
Damn you, Nine-Tails!

313
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:20,448
This is the moment I release
my fiery pent-up power!

314
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,658
Don't be hasty, Guy!

315
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,785
Come on! I'll be your opponent!

316
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,619
Wait!

317
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,620
Huh?

318
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,098
Gather immediately in the guardroom!

319
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:29,328
Why?

320
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,876
It's the Third Hokage's orders!

321
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:33,624
Lord Hiruzen?

322
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,810
You heard him. Let's go, Guy!

323
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:39,707
Now listen up.

324
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:42,734
You young shinobi are to
stay away from the Nine-Tails.

325
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,247
What do you mean by that?

326
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:47,867
This is not a battle between villages...

327
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,552
This is a domestic issue.

328
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:52,496
There is no reason for you
all to risk your lives.

329
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,679
Speak for yourself!

330
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,304
Calm down, Kurenai!

331
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,006
You're a shinobi too.

332
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:01,624
We are not guaranteed
to live a long life.

333
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,902
But, my daughter, you're a woman.

334
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:08,098
At least, pass on the Will of Fire
to my grandchild.

335
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,660
Make that your oath to your father...

336
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,844
For I do believe in you.

337
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:19,191
This is no time for a family argument!

338
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:24,168
I can't take not being able to do
anything at a time like this!

339
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:35,256
The barrier has disappeared!

340
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,397
Lord Fourth!

341
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,959
Lady Kushina!

342
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,330
Take her to Leaf Hospital immediately!

343
00:29:55,602 --> 00:29:57,100
Summon the Medical Ninja!

344
00:29:58,326 --> 00:29:59,410
Lord Third...

345
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,066
Kushina...!

346
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:04,811
Please take care...

347
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:06,831
of the child.

348
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,630
Of course, you don't need to worry.

349
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:11,609
His name is...

350
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:13,758
Naruto...

351
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,259
Minato and I...

352
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,902
picked it from...

353
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,943
Jiraiya-sensei's novel...

354
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:28,259
Naruto, you say?
Fine. I take full responsibility.

355
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,138
So, for the child's sake,
you must rest!

356
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:45,941
Kushina! I promise...

357
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:33,951
Minato...

358
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,120
Kushina...

359
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:39,244
You both gave your lives...

360
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:44,691
to protect the Hidden Leaf Village...
and its future.

361
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,707
<i>Minato-sensei...</i>

362
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,446
We repelled the Nine-Tails,

363
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:18,322
but the sacrifice was much too great.

364
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:23,265
This is no time for sentiment.
The Hokage's seat is empty.

365
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,877
We must decide on someone quickly.

366
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:31,125
Perhaps someone from
the age group below Minato?

367
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:33,861
We have nurtured fine Jonin,

368
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:38,859
but they all lack the experience
to rule over a village.

369
00:32:39,302 --> 00:32:40,929
Is there anyone else?

370
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,841
Well...

371
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,629
It cannot be helped.
This is a critical time.

372
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,690
I shall take over.

373
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,127
Oh, will you do that?

374
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,976
If you are willing...

375
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:58,763
You stepped down once...
Are you up to the task?

376
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:04,016
Truth be told, even though
you went after the Nine-Tails,

377
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:07,686
you failed to save the Fourth Hokage...

378
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,019
That remark is uncalled for.

379
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:14,050
And where were you
at that time, Danzo?

380
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,742
Just indulge this old man.

381
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:26,387
Let me fill in as Hokage until
we can groom the next one.

382
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:47,749
Kakashi Hatake, correct?

383
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:49,243
Lord Danzo...

384
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:53,566
Come and work under me.
What do you say?

385
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,327
But... I was Minato-sensei's...

386
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:00,656
Lord Fourth, the one
who recruited you into the ANBU

387
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,308
is no longer with us.

388
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,370
If you stay where you are,
you will end up working

389
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:09,398
directly under the Third
who will reassume his position.

390
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:14,212
It was his foolhardy ideals of peace
that dragged the war on

391
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:18,221
and drove Obito and Rin
to their deaths.

392
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:19,801
But...

393
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,304
Furthermore, on the night
of the Nine-Tails' rampage,

394
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:29,786
you were not able to join the fight
because of Lord Third's orders...

395
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,546
Isn't that why Lord Fourth
lost his life?

396
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:41,828
I don't want to believe that
he planned this to return to power...

397
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:46,667
But the future of the Leaf cannot be
entrusted to such a man.

398
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,371
A few ANBU will be selected to

399
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:59,248
guard the Feudal Lord's procession
back to his prefecture.

400
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,397
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

401
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:02,812
This is the plan.

402
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:19,844
<i>Wood Style?!</i>

403
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,512
<i>Wood Style: Giant Forest Jutsu!</i>

404
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:39,085
Halt!

405
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,687
I called him.

406
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:50,782
Yes, sir!

407
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,242
Thank you for coming.

408
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,001
Here...

409
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,101
The time has come.

410
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:08,988
Good work, Kakashi.

411
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,028
<i>Wood Style: Giant Forest Jutsu!</i>

412
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:23,250
<i>Who was the boy
that uses the Wood Style?</i>

413
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,139
<i>Maybe I'll find some information there.</i>

414
00:36:56,844 --> 00:36:58,096
<i>Found it.</i>

415
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:06,793
<i>Hashirama Senju... The leader of
the Senju Clan of the Forest,</i>

416
00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:11,155
<i>brought peace and stability to
this bloody, war-torn world.</i>

417
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:15,071
<i>He and he alone mastered
the Wood Style ninjutsu...</i>

418
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:22,118
<i>He and he alone mastered
the Wood Style ninjutsu...</i>

419
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:25,736
<i>No, there's one more.</i>

420
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:27,738
<i>What does this mean?</i>

421
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:30,507
<i>How is he able to use
the Wood Style?</i>

422
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:34,549
<i>Top secret?</i>

423
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,912
Where are the contents?

424
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:41,536
Is this what you are looking for?

425
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,147
Professor!

426
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,427
It's all right. I give you permission.

427
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:52,263
Read it.

428
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:53,550
Yes, sir!

429
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:57,852
Long ago, the First Hokage,
Lord Hashirama...

430
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:59,854
after a death match with Madara...

431
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:03,215
used the Wood Style to
suppress the Nine-Tails.

432
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:07,928
After that, there was no one to
take over the Wood Style Jutsu...

433
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:10,281
Either the Sharingan or
Wood Style are necessary

434
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,263
to suppress the Tailed-Beasts.

435
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:14,827
In the Hidden Leaf Village.

436
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,164
there was a time when
they researched

437
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:21,589
and tried to revive
the First's Wood Style Jutsu.

438
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,002
However...

439
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:28,237
despite the dedicated
efforts of many...

440
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:33,429
the tests to transplant Lord Hashirama's
cells failed one after another...

441
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,105
and the lives that were sacrificed
continued to grow.

442
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,471
And so...
unfortunately, that jutsu...

443
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:46,683
was deemed a Forbidden Jutsu
and sealed away.

444
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:51,906
But recently, Genin and Chunin,

445
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:57,311
and even members of the ANBU
have gone missing.

446
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:01,582
Furthermore, what's more disturbing
are incidents

447
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:04,902
where newborn infants
have been kidnapped

448
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:08,821
from hamlets surrounding
the Hidden Leaf Village.

449
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,157
Infants?!

450
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:15,513
Of those confirmed,
there have been 60 kidnappings.

451
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,206
Who could have...?!

452
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,687
What I'm about to tell you is hearsay...

453
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,838
Someone is continuing
the experiments

454
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:28,509
and trying to implant the cells
of Lord Hashirama.

455
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,695
Even if they're rumors,
why would anyone...?

456
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,595
There are those who want to obtain
every jutsu that exists.

457
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:37,374
Even I have wondered sometimes,

458
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:41,138
if there were only someone
who knows the Wood Style...

459
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:43,623
Had that been the case,

460
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:48,402
the Fourth Hokage need not
have sacrificed his life.

461
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:56,408
<i>Isn't that why Lord Fourth lost his life?</i>

462
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,726
Mind you, this is just hearsay.

463
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:04,433
If...

464
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:09,506
If Lord Hashirama's cells had
really been implanted into infants...

465
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:14,428
Implanting cells into infants
is forbidden...

466
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,562
And even if someone was doing so,

467
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:19,905
the possibility of it succeeding
would be very low.

468
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:25,791
However...

469
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:32,364
If... just if... the first infant who
was kidnapped survived...

470
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:35,364
He or she would be
ten years old already.

471
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:41,561
Ten years old...

472
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,530
Are you all here?

473
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:57,829
Yes, sir!

474
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,326
Tomorrow morning at
the hour of the tiger,

475
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,813
the Third Hokage and five ANBU
under his direct command

476
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,975
will depart for
the Feudal Lord's prefecture.

477
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:10,770
His purpose is to reassume
the Hokage post

478
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,280
left empty by Lord Fourth's demise.

479
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:15,157
If we allow this,

480
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:18,677
the Hidden Leaf Village will once again
be forced to accept

481
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:21,413
a weak and indecisive leader.

482
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:25,791
For the sake of the village,
we must prevent this at all cost.

483
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,313
Hence, your mission is...

484
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,840
somewhere along the route...

485
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:35,252
to assassinate the Third Hokage
quickly and discreetly.

486
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:38,447
Remember, no one must know of this.

487
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,500
It must appear that it was
the work of itinerant shinobi.

488
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:44,055
Understood?

489
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:45,554
– Yes, sir!
– Yes, sir!

490
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,126
Lord Third, are you ready?

491
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,910
Yes, let's depart!

492
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,572
Enemy attack!

493
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:05,337
<i>Wood Style Jutsu!</i>

494
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:06,688
What?!

495
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:13,970
<i>A Substitution?!</i>

496
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:24,158
<i>Wood Style: Giant Forest Jutsu!</i>

497
00:43:30,924 --> 00:43:31,835
<i>Chidori!</i>

498
00:43:48,235 --> 00:43:49,278
You...

499
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,031
Where did you learn the Wood Style?

500
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,885
I didn't expect an answer anyway...

501
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,174
Leave.

502
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,407
Go quickly!

503
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:06,740
That jutsu of yours will be critical for
the Hidden Leaf Village one day.

504
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:23,190
They were only after Lord Third.

505
00:44:23,655 --> 00:44:27,286
It seems their purpose was
to separate us from Lord Third.

506
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:29,718
They scattered off somewhere.

507
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:31,950
Were you all right here?

508
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:33,585
Yes...

509
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,697
Did you recognize the enemy?

510
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:39,175
I don't know who it was.

511
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:45,264
Well, that's all right.

512
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,173
I'm sure Lord Third will take care
of the rest.

513
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:01,859
I regret to inform you...

514
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:05,554
that I won't be giving up
this seat just yet...

515
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:12,703
It seems like you want to ask me
why I'm still alive...

516
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:13,937
It's nothing like that!

517
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:16,231
I understood that
you left this morning

518
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:17,980
for the Feudal Lord's prefecture.

519
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,210
A certain fellow betrayed me...

520
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,253
Rather, he came back to me...
and warned us

521
00:45:23,278 --> 00:45:27,796
that we would be targeted
on the way to the prefecture.

522
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:34,266
I can easily investigate and
find out who is behind this...

523
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:37,353
And that person will be executed.

524
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:39,380
That is as clear as day...

525
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:49,642
But it's against my principles
to cause any more death.

526
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,565
If I could meet that person,
I would tell him...

527
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:58,452
That I will overlook his actions
this time...

528
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:03,612
But in exchange,
he must do all that is in his power...

529
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:06,184
for the sake of the Hidden Leaf Village.

530
00:46:08,922 --> 00:46:11,424
You and your ideals of peace...

531
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:17,593
Mark my words, Hiruzen,
your naïve ideals will be your downfall.

532
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:20,508
Hmm... perhaps you're right.

533
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,959
We've always been this way.

534
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:37,684
You are the light and
I am the darkness.

535
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:42,192
Wherever there is light,
there is darkness.

536
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:47,797
But losing either one causes
disruptions in the world.

537
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:05,173
Professor...

538
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:08,107
I'm unqualified to be in the ANBU.

539
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:12,990
Why? Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

540
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:16,348
Still, I nearly betrayed you once.

541
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:21,740
I couldn't protect the Fourth Hokage...

542
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,304
I can't blame you if
you hate me for that.

543
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:31,221
Actually, when Minato was alive,
he came to speak to me about you.

544
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:41,148
I wanted him to forget the pain
in his heart, even just a little...

545
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:44,284
That's why I assigned him
to the ANBU.

546
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:48,318
But from the rumors I hear lately...

547
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:52,497
I think I might have made
the pain go even deeper.

548
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,839
Right now, I regret it.

549
00:47:57,135 --> 00:48:00,597
No one can heal a wounded heart...

550
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:04,629
Only time can heal all wounds.

551
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:06,112
Yes...

552
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,376
Well, there is one solution.

553
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:14,051
Why don't you assign him
to guard Kushina?

554
00:48:14,379 --> 00:48:16,381
If he leaves his duties with ANBU
to watch over

555
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:19,442
a woman who is about to
give birth to a new life,

556
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:22,114
perhaps it will trigger
a change in him.

557
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:23,873
You're right!

558
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:27,335
When Minato died...

559
00:48:27,794 --> 00:48:31,798
I considered releasing you
from the ANBU, for a moment.

560
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:36,380
But I am in need of your strength
at this time.

561
00:48:36,473 --> 00:48:37,432
Yes, sir!

562
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:42,866
Will you continue on as an ANBU
who reports directly to me?

563
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,361
Yes!

564
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:49,262
I hope that Minato will
forgive me as well...

565
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:55,926
Lord Third...
There's something I need to tell you.

566
00:48:56,118 --> 00:48:56,638
Hmm?

567
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:59,515
There's someone in the Foundation
who uses the Wood Style...

568
00:49:00,956 --> 00:49:02,624
Just as I thought...

569
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:08,585
I have an idea who it is.
Let me handle this.

570
00:49:09,385 --> 00:49:10,386
Yes, sir.

571
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:17,867
I see...

572
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:22,021
So you will be filling
the post again, Lord Third!

573
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:24,579
You have the knowledge
and experience already...

574
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:26,992
I am very relieved.

575
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:34,805
Is that man not here today?

576
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:39,455
The fierce-looking one
with that scary eye...

577
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:42,164
Do you mean Danzo?

578
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,613
Oh yes, he's the one.

579
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:49,504
He had an urgent matter to attend to,
so he is absent today.

580
00:49:49,726 --> 00:49:52,395
Oh... I see.

581
00:49:52,802 --> 00:49:55,471
I don't feel very comfortable
around him.

582
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:15,363
We must cease direct contact
between us for the time being.

583
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,703
Did something happen?

584
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,010
Kakashi betrayed me,

585
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,791
and there's a possibility
that Hiruzen knows about us.

586
00:50:26,913 --> 00:50:28,465
That's not good.

587
00:50:29,337 --> 00:50:33,101
In time, he might even learn
about this place and its secrets.

588
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:40,180
Well, we're dealing with Lord Third.
He'll be on to us eventually.

589
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:45,126
No... He probably has already guessed.

590
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:11,211
<i>Kakashi...</i>

591
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:48,225
<i>It won't wash off...</i>

592
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,577
Lord Third is reassuming
the title of Hokage...

593
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:05,181
I thought the changing of
the guard would usher in a new era...

594
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:08,270
I know what you mean, Genma...

595
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:11,454
It's not going to be easy
for Lord Third, you know!

596
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:13,147
Especially at his age!

597
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:16,515
We just have to do our best
for the village, that's all.

598
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,100
Let's celebrate the return of
Lord Third with some dumplings!

599
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:23,686
– Yeah!
– Yeah!

600
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:09,675
I-It's me! It's me, Kakashi!

601
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:17,687
You were seriously out
to get me just now!

602
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:19,172
I thought I was going to get killed!

603
00:53:21,174 --> 00:53:23,093
I could say the same to you.
What were you thinking?

604
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:24,819
I was just...

605
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:28,536
I just wanted to lure you into
continuing our rivalry showdowns.

606
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:32,577
Sorry...

607
00:53:54,354 --> 00:53:55,563
Is that you, Kinoto?

608
00:53:56,122 --> 00:53:58,416
Lord Danzo,
there's an urgent matter...

609
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,317
Hiruzen himself is leading them?

610
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,753
Damn him, he's gone too far.

611
00:54:15,645 --> 00:54:16,855
Kinoe, are you here?

612
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,858
Are you going to kill me?

613
00:54:43,642 --> 00:54:48,147
Can you still do it... Sarutobi-sensei?

614
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,183
And even with that...

615
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:02,875
No... it's because of that.

616
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:06,742
Hiruzen will not be able to
kill his student Orochimaru.

617
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,949
Sarutobi, you have to—!

618
00:55:43,154 --> 00:55:47,075
Just for times like this, we have
another secret meeting place.

619
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,014
Kinoe, go on ahead
and wait for Orochimaru.

620
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:20,778
<i>Chidori!</i>

621
00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:50,347
You...

622
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,793
I like the look in your eye.

623
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,596
However... I don't need a fake.

624
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:09,768
So cute...

625
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:12,677
Do you want to see his blood too?

626
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:28,955
Lord Third...

627
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,732
So you set this up.

628
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,254
Don't move!

629
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,586
So that's Orochimaru...

630
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:56,025
This emergency summons was called
regarding the capture of Orochimaru

631
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,377
who escaped during
the previous mission.

632
00:58:58,724 --> 00:59:03,062
According to intel reports,
Orochimaru is seriously wounded.

633
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:05,618
Considering his condition,

634
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,938
he will not be able to leave
the Land of Fire easily.

635
00:59:09,102 --> 00:59:10,039
Listen carefully.

636
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:13,293
The knowledge, data and jutsu
that Orochimaru possesses

637
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:16,081
are a valuable asset
to the Hidden Leaf.

638
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:20,049
If possible, bring him back alive.

639
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:22,994
If he leaves the Land of Fire...

640
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:26,619
... it will be a fatal blow
to the Leaf!

641
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,056
And so...

642
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:32,729
This must be settled before
he crosses the nation's borders.

643
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:35,052
Everyone, do your best.

644
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:36,549
Scatter!

645
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:43,964
You must love your pupil very much.

646
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:47,544
It's hard to believe that you
of all people would fail...

647
00:59:49,483 --> 00:59:51,527
I will be happy to cooperate.

648
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:54,588
For the sake of the Hidden Leaf,
I shall do everything I can.

649
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:57,714
Thank you. I'd appreciate that...

650
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,527
Whose grave is it?

651
01:00:21,738 --> 01:00:24,199
The friend he killed.

652
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:31,945
Kakashi Senpai...

653
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,532
Lord Hokage is calling.

654
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:36,673
All right.

655
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:42,486
Don't call me "Senpai." 
This isn't the academy.

656
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:44,900
You're still my senior in the ANBU.

657
01:00:45,086 --> 01:00:47,630
Besides, you're my role model.

658
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:50,494
Find someone more suitable.

659
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:57,705
Hey...

660
01:00:58,433 --> 01:01:00,477
Rin Nohara...

661
01:01:04,046 --> 01:01:07,865
You are aware that Orochimaru
has secret research facilities

662
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,435
scattered throughout the country,
aren't you?

663
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:11,277
Yes.

664
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,313
After he deserted the village,

665
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:18,563
he destroyed some and
kept some intact.

666
01:01:19,287 --> 01:01:21,983
Including ones that
we have no knowledge of.

667
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,649
It seems that way.

668
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:29,589
A small battalion on a mission came
upon such a facility by accident.

669
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:33,224
According to their report
upon their return,

670
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:38,229
it seems to be a research facility
that was abandoned by Orochimaru.

671
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:40,434
Did they go inside and investigate?

672
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:42,860
Fortunately, not yet.

673
01:01:43,898 --> 01:01:46,276
Right, since we don't know
what's inside.

674
01:01:47,172 --> 01:01:49,532
I do not want members
of our village

675
01:01:49,557 --> 01:01:52,977
to learn about his repulsive
research activities...

676
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:58,207
Of what happened to
their missing kin and friends.

677
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:01,183
However, an investigation is necessary.

678
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:04,655
So, you want me to go?

679
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:08,384
It's been three years since
Orochimaru left the village.

680
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:11,579
But he still remains
a thorn in our side.

681
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:14,248
I hate to ask you,
but please take care of this.

682
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:15,478
Yes, sir.

683
01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:37,735
I understand Orochimaru's hideout
was found.

684
01:02:37,813 --> 01:02:40,358
It's one of his research facilities.

685
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:42,777
I've dispatched someone
to investigate.

686
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:44,153
I see...

687
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,583
Is something troubling you?

688
01:02:46,966 --> 01:02:51,971
He could have set some kind
of trap before abandoning it.

689
01:02:52,576 --> 01:02:55,264
Are you sure it's safe
to investigate?

690
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,249
I sent an experienced and
qualified ANBU agent.

691
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:01,783
I hope nothing goes amiss.

692
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:48,556
Is that you, Kinoe?!

693
01:03:49,064 --> 01:03:51,316
It's been a while, Kakashi.

694
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,446
What are you doing here?

695
01:04:01,953 --> 01:04:03,288
I'm on a mission.

696
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,706
As my back-up?

697
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:08,281
No, that isn't it.

698
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:10,750
Did Lord Danzo dispatch
a Foundation shinobi,

699
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:14,900
because he's interested in
Orochimaru's research facility?

700
01:04:20,543 --> 01:04:23,328
Foundation shinobi never discuss
their mission... Is that it?

701
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:26,673
No matter.
You did help me out there.

702
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:30,311
We can't have you burned
to a crisp.

703
01:04:33,145 --> 01:04:35,259
Do you want to investigate
what's inside together?

704
01:04:36,268 --> 01:04:39,979
Whatever we find,
we'll share the intel with each other.

705
01:04:41,764 --> 01:04:42,781
What's wrong?

706
01:04:43,595 --> 01:04:46,083
We may be in different divisions,
but we're both Leaf shinobi.

707
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:47,951
Let's cooperate.

708
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:53,257
Yes...

709
01:04:53,524 --> 01:04:56,093
Who knows what demons or snakes
might pop out?

710
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,586
Let's go together.

711
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:58,982
Right.

712
01:05:07,564 --> 01:05:10,108
The only trap seems to have been
that one by the entrance.

713
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:15,281
Orochimaru must have been
in a hurry to escape.

714
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:18,784
You're right.
Still, we must be careful.

715
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,709
Yeah...

716
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:33,882
Let's go.

717
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:34,955
Right.

718
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,840
There's nothing in here.

719
01:05:58,491 --> 01:06:01,536
What was Orochimaru
experimenting on in here?

720
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:04,912
Probably his usual business...

721
01:06:04,937 --> 01:06:06,564
Experimenting on human subjects...

722
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,906
Human subjects...

723
01:06:12,622 --> 01:06:14,040
This one's no good.

724
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:15,330
This one as well.

725
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:16,578
That one too...

726
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:19,411
They're all no good...

727
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,732
This subject is a failure.

728
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:29,039
I thought that an adolescent
would adjust far better

729
01:06:29,064 --> 01:06:33,029
to propagate Hashirama's cells...

730
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,776
But it's just the opposite.

731
01:06:36,552 --> 01:06:39,096
A child doesn't have the strength
or stamina to endure it.

732
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:42,933
I guess I'll have to
shut this place down.

733
01:06:50,408 --> 01:06:51,500
<i>Wait!</i>

734
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,404
But not to worry.

735
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:57,717
There are many more ways
of cell implantation.

736
01:06:57,993 --> 01:07:00,370
I'll start the next test right away.

737
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:04,518
<i>Wait, wait...</i>

738
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:06,774
<i>Wait!</i>

739
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:11,973
Ki... noe.

740
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:13,948
Hey, Kinoe.

741
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:15,679
Let's go.

742
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:17,075
Right.

743
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:26,438
This one's locked.

744
01:07:26,886 --> 01:07:27,887
Leave it to me.

745
01:07:35,474 --> 01:07:36,433
It's open.

746
01:07:42,486 --> 01:07:44,098
Are you aware that the Wood Style Jutsu

747
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:46,956
is extremely important to the Leaf?

748
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,101
I didn't know that.

749
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:51,794
Your Wood Style jutsu isn't just
for the Foundation...

750
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,458
It's a power that should serve
the entire Leaf Village.

751
01:07:56,267 --> 01:07:59,020
Lord Danzo wants to
keep you at his side.

752
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:02,684
But you are more suited
to working directly under the Hokage.

753
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:05,658
Don't you want to leave the Foundation

754
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:08,302
and come out of the shadows?

755
01:08:15,837 --> 01:08:21,009
<i>No... no... I'm still alive!</i>

756
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:34,764
<i>N-No...</i>

757
01:08:45,257 --> 01:08:46,383
There's a survivor?!

758
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,271
What is this?

759
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:27,801
What's going on, Kinoe?!

760
01:09:30,006 --> 01:09:31,007
Kinoe!

761
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,783
Are you serious?!

762
01:09:37,894 --> 01:09:39,729
Yes, I'm serious!

763
01:10:00,604 --> 01:10:02,731
<i>I have the advantage.
All that's left is...</i>

764
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:07,554
<i>He knows how to fight
against my Sharingan.</i>

765
01:10:08,263 --> 01:10:10,015
<i>This was his intent
from the very beginning...</i>

766
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:14,058
Kinoe!

767
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:19,046
If you're serious about killing me,
then I won't hold back!

768
01:10:20,614 --> 01:10:22,491
It will be a death match between comrades!

769
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:24,916
I'm serious.

770
01:10:28,813 --> 01:10:30,190
I'm dead serious!

771
01:10:37,748 --> 01:10:39,583
Why do you want to kill me?

772
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,521
It's my mission.

773
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:44,347
What kind of mission sends
a friend after a friend?!

774
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:46,996
You're one to talk.

775
01:10:49,574 --> 01:10:52,452
You're the one who killed a friend.

776
01:10:53,108 --> 01:10:54,109
<i>A clone?!</i>

777
01:10:58,743 --> 01:10:59,744
<i>Wood Style Clone...</i>

778
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,445
You've gotten better
since the last time...

779
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:06,585
Yes. So don't hold back, Kakashi.

780
01:11:07,146 --> 01:11:08,814
I won't kill a friend!

781
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:10,519
No need to hold back!

782
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:13,712
Stop, Kinoe! Abandon this mission!

783
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:16,406
A shinobi's mission is absolute!

784
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,631
Kinoe!

785
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,124
A mission is not absolute!

786
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,586
If your orders are to kill a friend...

787
01:11:32,953 --> 01:11:34,700
that order is wrong!

788
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,663
The one who gave you
such an order is wrong.

789
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,280
<i>Could Lord Danzo be wrong?</i>

790
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:50,540
Can you walk?

791
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:54,209
What's the matter?

792
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:57,387
You don't seem to remember
who you are...

793
01:11:58,123 --> 01:11:59,833
but have you forgotten
how to talk as well?

794
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:01,712
Uh, no...

795
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:04,046
Follow me.

796
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:12,026
Orochimaru is greedy.

797
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:15,182
It's good to have the desire
to test out new things,

798
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,003
but he gives up too quickly.

799
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:21,715
However, you're lucky
he gave up on you.

800
01:12:22,765 --> 01:12:24,374
If you had stayed
with Orochimaru,

801
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:27,456
you would have ended up
another test subject.

802
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:41,500
My organization takes in shinobi
who have nowhere to go.

803
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:45,289
From now on, you will be
a shinobi of the Foundation.

804
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:47,009
The Foundation?

805
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,758
Yes. We are the Foundation.

806
01:12:49,758 --> 01:12:53,720
We support the great tree of
the Leaf from the darkness.

807
01:12:54,668 --> 01:12:58,338
Without strong roots,
a large tree cannot grow.

808
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:00,644
That is why we are the Foundation...

809
01:13:01,364 --> 01:13:03,532
You will be called Kinoe.

810
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:06,942
Henceforth, you are one of us.

811
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:14,383
You were one of 60.

812
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:15,164
Huh?

813
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:21,387
To create one Wood Style user,
59 other children were sacrificed...

814
01:13:22,782 --> 01:13:25,785
Kinoe, cherish your life.

815
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:27,587
Yes.

816
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,551
I'm leaving.

817
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:39,279
He said I'm going to be one of
the roots of the Hidden Leaf.

818
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:53,570
<i>Water Style!</i>

819
01:13:57,364 --> 01:14:00,076
You're able to infuse chakra
quite nicely now.

820
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:01,682
Yes!

821
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:07,772
All right. I shall train you myself.

822
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:10,192
Lord Danzo...?

823
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:11,343
Himself?

824
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:21,008
I once saw the First Hokage in battle.

825
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:24,394
Deep Forest Emergence...

826
01:14:24,557 --> 01:14:27,477
It's such a formidable Wood Style jutsu.

827
01:14:28,273 --> 01:14:31,442
If you have inherited his cells,
I put all my hopes in you...

828
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:36,120
Use Earth Style and Water Style

829
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:37,813
and release them simultaneously!

830
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,453
Not quite yet.

831
01:14:45,624 --> 01:14:46,625
I'm sorry.

832
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:48,368
It can't be helped.

833
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,655
You are not an exact copy
of the First Hokage.

834
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:58,411
Here is the Ninjutsu Scroll left
by the First Hokage.

835
01:14:59,221 --> 01:15:01,431
It's full of jutsu that I can't use,

836
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:04,262
but you should be able
to learn them.

837
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:06,882
Me? Learn jutsu that you cannot,
Lord Danzo?

838
01:15:07,495 --> 01:15:10,498
The world of the shinobi is filled
with a myriad of jutsu.

839
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,974
You cannot compete
with just one power.

840
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:16,280
We must master various jutsu

841
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:20,575
and use those powers
to unite the shinobi world.

842
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:25,414
I have high hopes for your Wood Style.

843
01:15:31,044 --> 01:15:32,940
Lord Danzo is not wrong!

844
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:38,051
I will fulfill my mission!

845
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:40,888
Why you...!

846
01:15:46,011 --> 01:15:47,262
To hell with your mission!

847
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,712
I'll say it again!

848
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,937
Killing a friend is not a mission!

849
01:15:52,462 --> 01:15:54,297
Then why did you kill her?!

850
01:15:54,879 --> 01:15:55,880
What?!

851
01:15:57,859 --> 01:15:59,945
Why did you kill Rin Nohara?!

852
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:13,512
Why did you kill her?
Why did you kill her?!

853
01:16:17,632 --> 01:16:19,551
You killed her because
it was your mission!

854
01:16:25,437 --> 01:16:27,557
Don't speak about Rin!

855
01:16:28,977 --> 01:16:30,520
As part of my ANBU missions,

856
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:33,482
I've had to deal with Rogue ninja
and traitors of the Hidden Leaf.

857
01:16:33,803 --> 01:16:37,265
So I don't care if they call me
"Friend-Killer Kakashi"...

858
01:16:38,434 --> 01:16:39,363
But...

859
01:16:39,532 --> 01:16:40,617
Rin was...

860
01:16:41,536 --> 01:16:42,537
Why you...!

861
01:16:47,147 --> 01:16:48,857
I didn't want to kill her!

862
01:16:54,602 --> 01:16:56,521
I couldn't protect my friend.

863
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:58,462
That's why Rin died...

864
01:16:59,357 --> 01:17:00,483
from this Chidori...

865
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:02,616
Couldn't protect her...?

866
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,276
<i>Couldn't protect her...</i>

867
01:17:27,688 --> 01:17:29,189
Are you going to... kill me?

868
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:31,604
Are you a friend
of the Hidden Leaf?

869
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,351
Or are you a traitor?

870
01:17:33,667 --> 01:17:35,252
I'm not a traitor.

871
01:17:36,289 --> 01:17:37,170
Then what are you?

872
01:17:37,838 --> 01:17:39,798
I am... Kinoe of the Foundation.

873
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,989
Then Kinoe... renounce your duty
to the Foundation.

874
01:17:44,608 --> 01:17:45,387
I cannot.

875
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:50,016
Then I'll take you into custody
and turn you over to Lord Hokage.

876
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:52,736
Do whatever... you please.

877
01:17:56,164 --> 01:17:56,877
Stand up!

878
01:18:02,175 --> 01:18:02,864
We're leaving.

879
01:18:03,468 --> 01:18:05,724
What about the mission, Kakashi?

880
01:18:06,122 --> 01:18:07,898
Our mission is to search this location.

881
01:18:08,492 --> 01:18:10,293
It's suspended, because of you.

882
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:12,446
Don't let me stop you.

883
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:15,375
You're trying to kill me,
so stop joking around.

884
01:18:15,694 --> 01:18:17,252
I'm not joking around.

885
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,381
Move!

886
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:30,974
I hear Foundation agents
are all trained

887
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:32,376
to discard their emotions.

888
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:33,582
Does the same go for you?

889
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,063
Not just our emotions.

890
01:18:37,266 --> 01:18:39,399
A shinobi of the Foundation
has no name, no past, no future.

891
01:18:39,574 --> 01:18:41,151
We have only our missions.

892
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,154
Well, you failed your mission.

893
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:55,540
This is...

894
01:18:55,604 --> 01:18:57,439
Don't inhale! It's poisonous! Run!

895
01:18:58,044 --> 01:18:59,045
R-Right!

896
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:05,094
Kakashi!

897
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,428
Kinoe, where's Kakashi?

898
01:19:53,686 --> 01:19:54,516
You did it?

899
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:55,892
Yes.

900
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:00,661
So you didn't need me.

901
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,941
Where's his body?

902
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:06,361
I made it appear like he was killed
by Orochimaru's trap.

903
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:09,364
Lord Hokage's ANBU
will probably find him.

904
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:12,367
Good. Let's return before
they get wind of us.

905
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:34,399
Kinoe?

906
01:20:42,896 --> 01:20:44,147
<i>To Kakashi...</i>

907
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,355
<i>I've become confused
about this mission,</i>

908
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,399
<i>where I'm supposed to kill a friend.</i>

909
01:20:50,363 --> 01:20:52,198
<i>So I'm going to abandon
this mission,</i>

910
01:20:52,657 --> 01:20:55,785
<i>and I will report to Lord Danzo
that I failed.</i>

911
01:20:56,419 --> 01:20:58,588
<i>Please take care.</i>

912
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:02,058
<i>Kinoe...!</i>

913
01:21:12,838 --> 01:21:14,668
Kakashi Senpai, we have to
tend to your wounds.

914
01:21:14,693 --> 01:21:15,694
I must report in first!

915
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:17,220
Hmm?

916
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:23,184
What's the matter?

917
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:24,316
Lord Third...

918
01:21:24,817 --> 01:21:26,652
Regarding Wood Style user
from the Foundation...

919
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:29,736
He targeted me.

920
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,640
Lord Danzo ordered it.

921
01:21:35,415 --> 01:21:40,788
But he abandoned his mission midway
and saved my life.

922
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:43,416
He then returned to the village.

923
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,877
But who knows what's happened
to him by now.

924
01:21:53,426 --> 01:21:57,430
Wh-What is the meaning of this, Kinoe!

925
01:21:57,889 --> 01:22:00,600
I beg your pardon.
I failed my mission.

926
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,520
If Kakashi beat you,

927
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:09,693
then it's my fault
for underestimating Kakashi's strength.

928
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:13,252
However, you abandoned your mission

929
01:22:13,277 --> 01:22:17,448
staged a poor cover-up,
and then returned here...

930
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:21,024
And I sent two men to do the job!

931
01:22:26,598 --> 01:22:28,002
What was your intention?

932
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:34,300
Answer me.
Why did you do this?

933
01:22:35,031 --> 01:22:37,637
Please go to Lord Danzo
and save Kinoe.

934
01:22:45,205 --> 01:22:46,312
Lord Third!

935
01:22:49,538 --> 01:22:53,862
It's agreed upon that
I don't interfere with the Foundation.

936
01:22:54,577 --> 01:22:56,740
However, that is not possible
in this case.

937
01:23:10,497 --> 01:23:11,421
Yugao.

938
01:23:11,824 --> 01:23:12,363
Sir!

939
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:15,842
Take this missive to
the Foundation headquarters.

940
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,887
It's an order from the Hokage.

941
01:23:19,387 --> 01:23:22,557
Summon Danzo here immediately.

942
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:23,771
Yes, sir!

943
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:37,984
I'm counting on you, Yugao.

944
01:23:38,672 --> 01:23:40,050
Please rest assured, my lord.

945
01:23:43,503 --> 01:23:44,370
Kakashi...

946
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:45,027
Sir.

947
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:48,680
Go to the infirmary and
tend to your wounds.

948
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,001
Yes, sir.

949
01:23:58,539 --> 01:23:59,540
Senpai?!

950
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,042
I'm coming with you.

951
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,178
Kakashi is a shinobi of the Leaf.

952
01:24:09,782 --> 01:24:14,161
He is a Leaf comrade.
Is it right to kill a comrade?

953
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:19,171
Consider only those in
the Foundation your comrades.

954
01:24:20,164 --> 01:24:22,992
Isn't the Foundation
a friend of the Hidden Leaf?

955
01:24:23,515 --> 01:24:25,678
The Foundation is a unique
organization that supports

956
01:24:25,703 --> 01:24:28,665
the large tree known as the Leaf,
from deep underground.

957
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:32,223
Just as a tree is divided into
what is above and below ground,

958
01:24:32,248 --> 01:24:34,542
the Foundation has its own existence.

959
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:38,869
Kinoto... What is a Foundation shinobi?

960
01:24:39,845 --> 01:24:42,612
Shinobi of the Foundation
have no names.

961
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:46,474
No emotion. No past. No future.

962
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:49,389
We have only our missions.

963
01:24:50,106 --> 01:24:53,439
As the leader of the Foundation,
my missions are absolute!

964
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:55,942
<i>No future...</i>

965
01:24:56,912 --> 01:25:00,707
<i>No past... No emotion?</i>

966
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:03,474
<i>No name?</i>

967
01:25:05,206 --> 01:25:07,254
<i>Welcome back, Tenzo!</i>

968
01:25:10,702 --> 01:25:12,036
Are you listening, Kinoe?!

969
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:15,956
No! My name is not Kinoe!

970
01:25:16,936 --> 01:25:18,201
What are you saying?

971
01:25:18,631 --> 01:25:20,466
You are Kinoe of the Foundation.

972
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:23,970
What other name could you have
besides that temporary one?

973
01:25:27,378 --> 01:25:29,005
I am a shinobi of the Leaf!

974
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:31,076
Not just of the Foundation!

975
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,755
A shinobi of the Hidden Leaf,
which has a trunk and branches!

976
01:25:35,654 --> 01:25:36,947
Everyone is my comrade!

977
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,684
Damn you...

978
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,685
What made you turn on us?!

979
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:48,745
Take him to the treatment room.

980
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:50,830
Bind him with a Curse Mark.

981
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:52,068
Sir!

982
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:57,405
Lord Third has summoned Lord Danzo.

983
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,664
Notify him that he is
to appear immediately.

984
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,677
Lord Danzo is not here.

985
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:05,887
What?

986
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,956
We will let him know
as soon as he returns.

987
01:26:09,432 --> 01:26:10,558
Where is he now?

988
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:12,498
We do not know.

989
01:26:13,394 --> 01:26:16,940
We aren't privy to Lord Danzo's schedule.

990
01:26:20,278 --> 01:26:22,572
Go back and report this to Lord Third.

991
01:26:23,323 --> 01:26:24,324
What about you?

992
01:26:24,563 --> 01:26:26,899
I'll stay here and wait for him. Go.

993
01:26:27,364 --> 01:26:28,054
Right.

994
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:46,874
Stop!

995
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:48,762
This is the Foundation jurisdiction!

996
01:26:56,938 --> 01:26:58,564
Where is Kinoe?

997
01:27:00,738 --> 01:27:01,989
Damn Kinoe...

998
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:04,704
What crazy thoughts did
Kakashi put in his head?

999
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:08,205
Lord Danzo, we're ready.

1000
01:27:20,767 --> 01:27:21,460
<i>Release!</i>

1001
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:24,034
Let's get out of here!

1002
01:27:25,938 --> 01:27:26,873
Kakashi?!

1003
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,305
Kinoe!

1004
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:34,568
<i>Wood Style!</i>

1005
01:27:36,839 --> 01:27:37,840
Hey, wait!

1006
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:43,709
Found him! Over there!

1007
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:52,675
<i>Wind Style:</i>

1008
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:54,593
<i>Vacuum Bullets!</i>

1009
01:27:57,615 --> 01:27:59,617
<i>Wood Style: Domed Wall!</i>

1010
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:10,906
How good of you to come over
from your side, Kakashi.

1011
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:14,234
You entered the Foundation's jurisdiction
without authorization

1012
01:28:14,259 --> 01:28:16,469
and tried to take one of our own.

1013
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,401
Don't think you'll get off so easily.

1014
01:28:27,297 --> 01:28:28,857
Lord Danzo, Kakashi is...

1015
01:28:28,882 --> 01:28:29,883
Silence!

1016
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:34,152
And you won't get away with this either.

1017
01:28:34,535 --> 01:28:35,953
Neither shall you...

1018
01:28:49,335 --> 01:28:50,545
Hiruzen...

1019
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:54,246
I know that you bear
a grudge against Kakashi.

1020
01:28:54,756 --> 01:29:00,428
But that's no cause to target
one of our best shinobi.

1021
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:02,504
What are you talking about, Hiruzen?

1022
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:05,794
I couldn't care less about Kakashi.

1023
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:08,920
However, he trespassed
by his own accord,

1024
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:10,738
into Foundation territory
and that is serious.

1025
01:29:11,432 --> 01:29:12,475
"By his own accord"?

1026
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:17,689
No, I dispatched him with
a summons from me.

1027
01:29:18,078 --> 01:29:22,916
Then he went looking for you.

1028
01:29:23,376 --> 01:29:24,919
On my orders.

1029
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:32,158
There must've been
a communication mix-up.

1030
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:34,664
I'm hearing that for the first time.

1031
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:38,762
Well then, that settles it
with Kakashi.

1032
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:43,281
It's regarding this next issue
that I sent for you.

1033
01:29:44,522 --> 01:29:48,234
It's regarding another
superior shinobi of this village.

1034
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:50,892
You know that the Wood Style user

1035
01:29:50,917 --> 01:29:54,163
has long been desired
in Hidden Leaf Village.

1036
01:29:54,907 --> 01:30:00,246
There even was a period when
we conducted tests to acquire that power.

1037
01:30:01,819 --> 01:30:04,322
Now I understand there
is such a Wood Style user.

1038
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:07,045
Why would you keep him hidden
within the Foundation?

1039
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:11,073
I found him.
And I protected and raised him.

1040
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:13,467
It's not like I was hiding him.

1041
01:30:13,798 --> 01:30:16,685
I just felt there was no need
to report it to you.

1042
01:30:17,802 --> 01:30:19,095
Listen, Danzo.

1043
01:30:19,935 --> 01:30:23,188
The Jinchuriki child is
now four years old.

1044
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,975
The Wood Style Sealing Jutsu
is becoming

1045
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,293
more and more crucial to the village.

1046
01:30:30,022 --> 01:30:31,690
So...

1047
01:30:32,878 --> 01:30:35,881
Will you entrust this user to me?

1048
01:30:36,437 --> 01:30:39,023
I'll assign him to the ANBU
under my direct control.

1049
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:41,859
But...

1050
01:30:42,506 --> 01:30:44,133
Please, Danzo.

1051
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:47,073
I know he is a valuable
subordinate to you.

1052
01:30:47,301 --> 01:30:50,929
But for the sake of the Hidden Leaf,
transfer him to me.

1053
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:01,998
Then all will be settled amicably...

1054
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:09,855
Members of the Foundation
are bound by a Curse Mark,

1055
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,901
so they do not
reveal top-secret intel.

1056
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:14,481
I will not remove the Curse Mark.

1057
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:16,378
That is fine.

1058
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:17,654
All right then...

1059
01:31:18,741 --> 01:31:20,743
I now receive him into my care.

1060
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:25,894
Henceforth, you will be an ANBU
under my direct orders.

1061
01:31:32,852 --> 01:31:33,586
Umm...

1062
01:31:43,991 --> 01:31:45,659
Thank you for everything.

1063
01:31:57,863 --> 01:31:58,850
H-Hello...

1064
01:31:59,245 --> 01:32:02,070
I just transferred here from
the Foundation. My name is Kinoe.

1065
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:06,274
Hey, Tenzo!

1066
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:08,770
Tenzo?

1067
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:11,569
Kinoe was your codename
in the Foundation.

1068
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:14,048
In the ANBU,
you should call yourself Tenzo.

1069
01:32:14,422 --> 01:32:15,798
But that name is...

1070
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:20,377
Didn't you call yourself Tenzo
in the past?

1071
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:22,905
All right, everyone!

1072
01:32:23,085 --> 01:32:25,212
This is Tenzo, the newbie!

1073
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,783
I can vouch for his skill.

1074
01:32:28,894 --> 01:32:29,895
Nice to meet you!

1075
01:32:30,896 --> 01:32:31,772
Welcome!

1076
01:32:31,941 --> 01:32:34,235
– Nice to meet you, Tenzo!
– I expect good things from you!

1077
01:32:34,852 --> 01:32:36,270
Tenzo... huh?

1078
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:40,881
Tenzo, you're on my squad. Team Ro!

1079
01:32:41,178 --> 01:32:42,597
I'm counting on you.

1080
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:46,223
Okay, Senpai!

1081
01:32:56,973 --> 01:32:57,974
Damn it!

1082
01:33:10,269 --> 01:33:13,648
As usual, your Chidori
is as brilliant as ever, Senpai.

1083
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,666
Brilliant?

1084
01:33:16,826 --> 01:33:18,992
There is no brilliant or crude
in an assassination...

1085
01:33:20,857 --> 01:33:22,025
A kill is a kill, that's all.

1086
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:28,912
By the way, what happened
to the replacement?

1087
01:33:29,839 --> 01:33:31,173
Our team is short a member.

1088
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,173
There's no rush.

1089
01:33:34,032 --> 01:33:35,784
We're not in the middle
of a war or anything.

1090
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,099
Sooner or later,
someone will show up.

1091
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:48,206
Hey, Kakashi.

1092
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:50,401
What's up? You look tired.

1093
01:33:51,168 --> 01:33:52,254
Did you just get off a mission?

1094
01:33:52,641 --> 01:33:53,934
You're such an idiot, Guy.

1095
01:33:54,201 --> 01:33:56,871
Members of the ANBU can't
discuss details of their work!

1096
01:33:57,603 --> 01:33:58,770
That's how it goes.

1097
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:02,304
We're going out for
some sweet dumplings.

1098
01:34:02,993 --> 01:34:05,663
- Want to join us?
- Sorry, I don't really like sweets...

1099
01:34:08,371 --> 01:34:11,445
He's gotten so antisocial lately.

1100
01:34:13,373 --> 01:34:15,500
Maybe it's because of
all the secrecy in the ANBU...

1101
01:34:16,329 --> 01:34:18,498
No! No way!

1102
01:34:18,765 --> 01:34:20,767
Kakashi is my lifelong rival.

1103
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,843
He's got a heart that's filled
with burning passion.

1104
01:34:23,377 --> 01:34:26,093
All right, since it's come to this,
it's up to me to do something!

1105
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:28,837
You?

1106
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:31,083
Please let me join the ANBU!

1107
01:34:31,745 --> 01:34:33,914
It's the best thing to do
for Kakashi's sake!

1108
01:34:34,726 --> 01:34:36,060
Now, now, Guy.

1109
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:40,170
I understand your concern
for Kakashi.

1110
01:34:40,993 --> 01:34:43,079
But the saying "the right person
for the right job"

1111
01:34:43,104 --> 01:34:44,397
applies to this situation...

1112
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:47,722
Your unique skills wouldn't be put
to their best use in the ANBU.

1113
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:50,236
It's not about what's
good for me, Lord Third!

1114
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:52,713
As Kakashi's partner, I...

1115
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:56,355
Silence! You are not suited
for the ANBU.

1116
01:35:02,824 --> 01:35:06,362
Not... suited...

1117
01:35:12,245 --> 01:35:13,971
L-Lord Danzo...

1118
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:15,047
What is it?

1119
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:18,197
Please let me join your ANBU!

1120
01:35:19,262 --> 01:35:21,033
You lack it.

1121
01:35:22,128 --> 01:35:23,129
Lack what?

1122
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:25,401
Darkness.

1123
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:32,542
Darkness?

1124
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:48,650
A new member will be
joining your team.

1125
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,376
Is it the one
we previously discussed?

1126
01:35:50,735 --> 01:35:53,405
Yes, he's extremely capable.

1127
01:35:54,177 --> 01:35:56,012
But he's young.

1128
01:35:56,746 --> 01:36:00,333
Danzo recommended that
he gain more experience.

1129
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:06,278
Here's your equipment.

1130
01:36:08,296 --> 01:36:09,297
Thank you very much.

1131
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:16,506
I've been assigned to
the ANBU from today.

1132
01:36:16,808 --> 01:36:17,880
My name is Itachi Uchiha.

1133
01:36:19,091 --> 01:36:20,259
I'd appreciate your guidance.

1134
01:36:21,698 --> 01:36:23,200
I see. So you're the one.

1135
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,618
Use the locker that's
the farthest one in the back.

1136
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:26,740
Yes, sir.

1137
01:36:30,434 --> 01:36:31,436
Is that him?

1138
01:36:31,461 --> 01:36:32,838
They say he's eleven years old.

1139
01:36:33,842 --> 01:36:36,136
Doesn't that make him
the youngest ANBU ever?

1140
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,880
Team Ro is to assemble at
the Third Training Ground

1141
01:36:40,905 --> 01:36:41,948
in five minutes.

1142
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:43,426
Yes, sir.

1143
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:14,180
What are you doing?

1144
01:37:16,392 --> 01:37:17,560
Explain yourselves!

1145
01:37:18,337 --> 01:37:21,420
We wanted to make sure he had
the skills to be one of us.

1146
01:37:21,567 --> 01:37:22,950
Since he's too young.

1147
01:37:23,506 --> 01:37:25,570
Do you have a problem with
the decision of your superiors?

1148
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:28,376
No, it's not like that...

1149
01:37:28,995 --> 01:37:32,999
Haven't you already sensed
that he isn't ordinary?

1150
01:37:35,556 --> 01:37:37,099
I'm Kakashi, captain of Team Ro.

1151
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,813
You're new,

1152
01:37:38,904 --> 01:37:41,406
but I want you to learn the ANBU
rules and formations quickly.

1153
01:37:42,099 --> 01:37:42,836
Yes, sir.

1154
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:05,278
He's good.

1155
01:38:06,275 --> 01:38:08,111
He is talented,
but making an exception

1156
01:38:08,486 --> 01:38:11,990
for someone so young is
rather unusual for the ANBU.

1157
01:38:12,116 --> 01:38:14,284
Lord Danzo recommended him.

1158
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:18,365
No kidding?
He doesn't fit the mold though.

1159
01:38:18,655 --> 01:38:19,506
What do you mean?

1160
01:38:20,331 --> 01:38:22,565
Lord Danzo has
his own personal set of criteria

1161
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,326
for ANBU and Foundation agents.

1162
01:38:24,888 --> 01:38:25,553
And?

1163
01:38:26,652 --> 01:38:28,120
I just can't see him...

1164
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,161
Are you getting used to the job?

1165
01:38:36,681 --> 01:38:37,688
Not yet.

1166
01:38:37,837 --> 01:38:38,880
That's unlike you.

1167
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:40,971
I haven't gone out
on a mission yet.

1168
01:38:41,959 --> 01:38:44,253
Protecting the Lord Hokage
is a mission in and of itself.

1169
01:38:45,082 --> 01:38:47,751
Isn't the ANBU an assassination
and special tactical unit?

1170
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:50,701
Well, we're not at war right now.

1171
01:38:57,382 --> 01:38:58,717
- Kakashi...
- Sir?

1172
01:39:00,436 --> 01:39:03,814
As the Hokage, every deployment
I order is an official one.

1173
01:39:04,262 --> 01:39:07,318
However, I cannot
ignore Danzo's view

1174
01:39:07,448 --> 01:39:09,742
that there is a darker side
to this mission.

1175
01:39:09,915 --> 01:39:13,877
Hence, a separate unofficial team
will be dispatched.

1176
01:39:14,809 --> 01:39:17,478
One that the Hokage didn't order?

1177
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:21,251
You will work under Danzo.

1178
01:39:23,759 --> 01:39:25,761
On the surface,
this is a diplomatic mission.

1179
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:29,090
We will be exchanging intel
with the Hannya Black Ops

1180
01:39:29,176 --> 01:39:31,511
of the Land of Woods
at the border.

1181
01:39:31,939 --> 01:39:36,861
However...
I believe this is an enemy trap.

1182
01:39:37,355 --> 01:39:39,524
Lord Third agrees with me on this.

1183
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:44,505
The ANBU will guard the team
on the official mission.

1184
01:39:44,797 --> 01:39:49,719
When the enemy turns on
the team and attacks, kill them.

1185
01:39:50,154 --> 01:39:51,823
Leave no survivors.

1186
01:39:52,882 --> 01:39:54,054
Total annihilation?

1187
01:39:54,785 --> 01:39:56,670
We must show them
that the Hidden Leaf

1188
01:39:56,695 --> 01:39:57,821
does not tolerate betrayal.

1189
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:01,179
I'd like to be in
a two-man squad with Itachi.

1190
01:40:01,878 --> 01:40:02,786
Fine.

1191
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,326
If I may take my leave...

1192
01:40:04,835 --> 01:40:05,836
Kakashi...

1193
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,202
I recognize your worth as an ANBU...

1194
01:40:08,358 --> 01:40:10,819
I'm even tempted to recruit you
into the Foundation.

1195
01:40:11,451 --> 01:40:12,619
Surely, you jest...

1196
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:16,564
I'm serious.
You have the right qualities.

1197
01:40:16,818 --> 01:40:18,904
A quality called darkness.

1198
01:40:20,246 --> 01:40:21,767
You will conduct a secret exchange

1199
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:23,627
with the Hannya Black Ops
of the Land of Woods.

1200
01:40:24,138 --> 01:40:26,709
The Hidden Leaf will
hand over this scroll.

1201
01:40:27,617 --> 01:40:30,537
And you will accept
a scroll from them.

1202
01:40:32,931 --> 01:40:34,950
Do we verify the contents?

1203
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:38,856
This is a test of mutual trust.

1204
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,355
If they hand over a fake scroll,

1205
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,461
it will prove that
the Land of Woods has no interest

1206
01:40:44,486 --> 01:40:47,144
in an alliance
with the Hidden Leaf.

1207
01:40:48,193 --> 01:40:51,864
So if nothing happens,
we just bring back the scroll?

1208
01:40:52,186 --> 01:40:56,761
Yes. Presently, we have no
hostility with the Land of Woods,

1209
01:40:56,902 --> 01:41:00,780
but we cannot be certain.
Be very careful.

1210
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,766
Leave it to us!

1211
01:41:17,389 --> 01:41:20,183
Hey, Itachi.
So it's your first ANBU mission.

1212
01:41:20,787 --> 01:41:21,477
Right.

1213
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:24,615
I heard it's just Captain Kakashi
and you on a two-man cell.

1214
01:41:25,038 --> 01:41:26,187
Watch your back.

1215
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:27,745
Why?

1216
01:41:28,103 --> 01:41:29,994
If it's for the sake of a mission,

1217
01:41:30,019 --> 01:41:31,676
the Captain won't hesitate
to kill a comrade.

1218
01:41:32,015 --> 01:41:34,268
He's a true shinobi, through and through.

1219
01:41:44,371 --> 01:41:45,372
Okay, everyone!

1220
01:41:45,487 --> 01:41:49,616
Fire up your youthful passion
and... let's go!

1221
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:52,835
Please wait, Captain!

1222
01:41:53,659 --> 01:41:57,125
I'm way past my youthful days...

1223
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:05,890
So they weren't told of
the true nature of this mission?

1224
01:42:06,349 --> 01:42:10,537
No. The only ones who know
are the top ranks of the Leaf

1225
01:42:10,562 --> 01:42:12,397
and the two of us.

1226
01:42:30,271 --> 01:42:32,640
You're with the Hannya Black Ops
of the Land of Woods, correct?

1227
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:35,656
Indeed, we are.
Now hand over the scroll!

1228
01:42:36,259 --> 01:42:38,220
- All right then at the same time...
- You first.

1229
01:42:39,226 --> 01:42:40,040
Fine then.

1230
01:42:46,854 --> 01:42:48,272
There's no mistake.

1231
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:50,649
And your scroll?

1232
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:51,749
Here it is.

1233
01:42:53,513 --> 01:42:54,514
Huh?!

1234
01:43:00,703 --> 01:43:02,705
We're supposed to
exchange scrolls, not fire!

1235
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:09,768
The Hidden Leaf reneged on
our agreement and attacked us.

1236
01:43:10,176 --> 01:43:11,813
We shall seek retribution.

1237
01:43:12,512 --> 01:43:13,972
That's a shameless lie.

1238
01:43:14,252 --> 01:43:16,796
You're the one who broke
the agreement!

1239
01:43:20,584 --> 01:43:21,585
Captain?!

1240
01:43:22,544 --> 01:43:24,838
They planned on betraying us
from the beginning!

1241
01:43:25,128 --> 01:43:26,660
We'll take over from here.

1242
01:43:26,988 --> 01:43:28,557
- You guys get away from here.
- You guys?!

1243
01:43:28,582 --> 01:43:29,349
- ANBU?!
- Reinforcements!

1244
01:43:30,895 --> 01:43:31,709
<i>- Earth Style:
- Earth Style:</i>

1245
01:43:31,828 --> 01:43:33,163
<i>- Rock Collapse!
- Rock Collapse!</i>

1246
01:43:34,765 --> 01:43:35,766
Run!

1247
01:43:38,708 --> 01:43:40,543
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

1248
01:44:04,634 --> 01:44:06,427
Your mission's complete.

1249
01:44:07,248 --> 01:44:08,044
Return to the village.

1250
01:44:12,199 --> 01:44:13,550
Hey, what are you doing?!

1251
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:17,183
This is the mission
we were assigned.

1252
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:21,157
Even still. Stop, Kakashi!

1253
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:23,075
Hey!

1254
01:44:23,286 --> 01:44:25,159
Don't use my real name
while I'm on an ANBU mission!

1255
01:44:26,106 --> 01:44:27,035
You!

1256
01:44:31,184 --> 01:44:32,684
Not to worry, Captain.

1257
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:34,843
No enemy survivors remain.

1258
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:47,535
I'm going to report back
to Lord Danzo.

1259
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,752
Your part of the mission
is complete.

1260
01:44:50,941 --> 01:44:51,520
Captain...

1261
01:44:52,417 --> 01:44:55,757
That Sharingan wasn't
originally yours, was it?

1262
01:44:56,757 --> 01:44:57,618
No...

1263
01:44:58,129 --> 01:45:00,696
Aren't you uncomfortable
about possessing a power

1264
01:45:00,834 --> 01:45:02,086
that wasn't your own?

1265
01:45:03,514 --> 01:45:05,239
You're not an Uchiha.

1266
01:45:06,265 --> 01:45:08,345
But you possess the Sharingan,

1267
01:45:08,597 --> 01:45:10,933
so you wield the same power
as the Uchiha.

1268
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:14,194
Whose side are you on?

1269
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:16,978
I've never thought about it
in that way.

1270
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:20,859
A friend entrusted
this Sharingan to me...

1271
01:45:21,687 --> 01:45:25,137
He made me promise to remember
what's truly important.

1272
01:45:26,212 --> 01:45:27,040
A friend?

1273
01:45:27,228 --> 01:45:27,912
Yeah.

1274
01:45:28,784 --> 01:45:30,786
To always protect my comrades.

1275
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,393
I see, well done.

1276
01:45:43,057 --> 01:45:43,905
Lord Third...

1277
01:45:45,126 --> 01:45:48,118
I understand why you said that
the ANBU is not suited for me.

1278
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:49,923
I see...

1279
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:55,699
But I don't think that Kakashi is
suited to be in the ANBU either.

1280
01:45:56,846 --> 01:45:57,864
Is that so?

1281
01:46:00,474 --> 01:46:01,767
How did the newbie do?

1282
01:46:02,515 --> 01:46:06,769
He passed with flying colors.
He'll be a better ANBU than me.

1283
01:46:07,787 --> 01:46:11,124
No, you're an exceptional ANBU,
Senpai...

1284
01:46:12,223 --> 01:46:15,351
There's a darkness associated
with ANBU missions.

1285
01:46:15,979 --> 01:46:17,939
Why are you saying this
all of a sudden?

1286
01:46:18,735 --> 01:46:21,487
All of a sudden? You're right.

1287
01:46:22,212 --> 01:46:26,007
Deception and killing is
all part of the mission...

1288
01:46:35,329 --> 01:46:36,164
Big brother!

1289
01:46:36,703 --> 01:46:38,037
Let's go home together, Sasuke!

1290
01:46:38,832 --> 01:46:41,022
Okay! So you're done
with your mission?

1291
01:46:44,176 --> 01:46:45,177
Big brother! Guess what?

1292
01:46:45,614 --> 01:46:49,090
My Sensei praised me
at the Academy today.

1293
01:47:00,171 --> 01:47:01,742
Hey, Kakashi...

1294
01:47:02,358 --> 01:47:04,829
Sorry about what happened
during the mission.

1295
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:07,633
No... I'm sorry too.

1296
01:47:30,546 --> 01:47:32,197
You're part of the ANBU now and

1297
01:47:32,425 --> 01:47:34,850
this is one mission
you cannot avoid.

1298
01:47:35,005 --> 01:47:36,424
What kind of mission is this?

1299
01:47:37,224 --> 01:47:40,164
When the Nine-Tails incident
occurred six years ago,

1300
01:47:40,288 --> 01:47:44,292
the higher-ups suspected
the Uchiha Clan was behind it.

1301
01:47:45,152 --> 01:47:48,947
Since then, the Uchiha district has been
under 24-hour surveillance.

1302
01:47:52,036 --> 01:47:53,037
Time to switch.

1303
01:47:54,116 --> 01:47:55,220
Nothing to report.

1304
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:56,191
This is...

1305
01:47:56,216 --> 01:47:58,427
This isn't the only
surveillance center around.

1306
01:47:58,823 --> 01:48:00,992
Lord Danzo's ANBU are
also watching them.

1307
01:48:01,512 --> 01:48:02,644
Now what'll you do?

1308
01:48:02,735 --> 01:48:04,869
Notify your clan about this?

1309
01:48:05,775 --> 01:48:07,335
What is my job here?

1310
01:48:08,166 --> 01:48:10,043
Just keep watching through that.

1311
01:48:11,475 --> 01:48:13,945
Okay, Captain. We're going.

1312
01:48:14,588 --> 01:48:16,742
Stay alert, Itachi.

1313
01:48:19,785 --> 01:48:21,746
This is part of our job as ANBU.

1314
01:48:22,277 --> 01:48:23,695
It's not assassination

1315
01:48:24,102 --> 01:48:26,565
but it's still dirty work.

1316
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:28,317
A mission is a mission.

1317
01:48:28,789 --> 01:48:33,377
You'll be spying on your friends
and family. It's even dirtier.

1318
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,584
I can take this shift,
if you want.

1319
01:48:35,985 --> 01:48:38,137
No, that's not necessary.
Besides...

1320
01:48:38,886 --> 01:48:39,643
Besides?

1321
01:48:40,971 --> 01:48:45,600
The Uchiha Clan is aware
that they're under suspicion.

1322
01:48:47,297 --> 01:48:48,339
I guess you would be.

1323
01:48:52,468 --> 01:48:54,624
Go to hell!

1324
01:48:54,649 --> 01:48:56,365
What the hell was that for?!

1325
01:48:56,657 --> 01:48:59,048
You're the one that...

1326
01:48:59,443 --> 01:49:00,694
It's your fault.

1327
01:49:00,915 --> 01:49:02,833
- It wasn't me!
- Sure, it was!

1328
01:49:02,858 --> 01:49:04,520
Hey, stop that!

1329
01:49:05,031 --> 01:49:06,533
Hey, what's going on?!

1330
01:49:07,778 --> 01:49:09,238
Calm down!

1331
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,176
Why you...!

1332
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:13,240
Who needs the Police Force?!

1333
01:49:13,684 --> 01:49:15,966
Just go and hide like you did
with the Nine-Tails!

1334
01:49:16,494 --> 01:49:17,934
What did you say?

1335
01:49:19,401 --> 01:49:20,610
Ow ow ow!

1336
01:49:20,696 --> 01:49:22,004
We're taking you both into custody!

1337
01:49:22,207 --> 01:49:23,500
Let me go!

1338
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:25,830
Be quiet and walk!

1339
01:49:25,915 --> 01:49:27,378
It was just a drunken argument...

1340
01:49:27,929 --> 01:49:29,889
Couldn't they just
stop the fighting?

1341
01:49:33,709 --> 01:49:38,088
Complaints about harsh treatment
by the Police Force are on the rise.

1342
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:41,995
People have started
to distrust them.

1343
01:49:42,523 --> 01:49:44,938
The Uchiha are growing impudent.

1344
01:49:45,035 --> 01:49:46,765
No, it's backlash.

1345
01:49:47,593 --> 01:49:51,153
The negativity from the Nine-Tails' incident
six years ago still hangs over them.

1346
01:49:52,033 --> 01:49:55,036
The Uchiha didn't suffer
any damage that time.

1347
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,432
That is the cause of suspicion...

1348
01:49:59,178 --> 01:50:03,807
Furthermore, the Uchiha viewed
our distancing them from the Nine-Tails

1349
01:50:03,985 --> 01:50:08,937
as a sign of
the Hidden Leaf's distrust.

1350
01:50:09,005 --> 01:50:12,448
Our strategy of isolating the Uchiha
is a fundamental policy of the Leaf

1351
01:50:12,473 --> 01:50:14,260
put in place by the Second Hokage.

1352
01:50:14,549 --> 01:50:16,123
Why are they raising a fuss
after all this time?

1353
01:50:16,577 --> 01:50:19,288
The Lord Second's intention
wasn't isolation.

1354
01:50:19,617 --> 01:50:21,783
He was just concerned for each clan.

1355
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:25,776
Have you forgotten about
our friend Kagami Uchiha?

1356
01:50:26,011 --> 01:50:27,554
I haven't forgotten.

1357
01:50:28,215 --> 01:50:30,973
He saved me many times
with his visual jutsu.

1358
01:50:31,606 --> 01:50:34,692
The Uchiha Clan is
a friend of the Hidden Leaf.

1359
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,199
We must ensure
they stay that way.

1360
01:50:38,197 --> 01:50:40,282
If we can...

1361
01:50:53,799 --> 01:50:54,586
Move out!

1362
01:50:55,015 --> 01:50:57,935
My team will go to the Hidden Leaf
Police Force Headquarters!

1363
01:50:58,174 --> 01:51:00,051
My team will go to Uchiha District!

1364
01:51:07,453 --> 01:51:08,558
This is horrible!

1365
01:51:09,149 --> 01:51:10,484
What the hell?

1366
01:51:13,092 --> 01:51:15,219
Rescue anyone who is still alive!

1367
01:51:16,801 --> 01:51:18,651
There's a survivor!

1368
01:51:19,393 --> 01:51:20,894
Take him to the Medical Unit!

1369
01:51:27,773 --> 01:51:29,441
Everyone else is dead.

1370
01:51:31,778 --> 01:51:33,561
Take away the corpses.

1371
01:51:34,122 --> 01:51:35,657
I mean, every single one.

1372
01:51:35,841 --> 01:51:37,717
Check inside the buildings as well.

1373
01:51:38,022 --> 01:51:41,693
Who could have done such a thing?

1374
01:51:42,407 --> 01:51:43,950
Itachi Uchiha.

1375
01:51:44,443 --> 01:51:45,120
Itachi?!

1376
01:51:45,691 --> 01:51:49,349
Itachi Uchiha despised his clan.

1377
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,797
Enough talking. Get to work!

1378
01:52:05,537 --> 01:52:06,955
<i>What's up with him?</i>

1379
01:52:15,622 --> 01:52:16,432
Hey!

1380
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:23,649
The entire clan was annihilated...

1381
01:52:24,188 --> 01:52:28,526
Not everyone.
I hear one child survived.

1382
01:52:29,071 --> 01:52:30,405
What's the difference?

1383
01:52:30,812 --> 01:52:33,648
The Uchiha Clan is extinct.

1384
01:52:34,093 --> 01:52:35,761
All except one.

1385
01:52:38,567 --> 01:52:42,938
I never imagined that Itachi Uchiha
would be placed in the Bingo Book.

1386
01:52:43,899 --> 01:52:45,944
In the S-class right from the start.

1387
01:52:46,797 --> 01:52:49,800
Well, he slaughtered so many of his clan...

1388
01:52:50,743 --> 01:52:52,450
What's wrong, Senpai?

1389
01:52:53,487 --> 01:52:57,829
It just goes to show
I knew nothing about him.

1390
01:52:58,659 --> 01:53:00,661
I understood nothing.

1391
01:53:02,106 --> 01:53:05,902
By the way, I hear Uchiha District
will be razed to the ground.

1392
01:53:06,539 --> 01:53:07,535
Razed?

1393
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:14,869
A terrible incident took place there.
No one would want to go near it.

1394
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:27,585
<i>Obito...</i>

1395
01:53:28,363 --> 01:53:31,992
<i>What have I been doing...
since that day?</i>

1396
01:53:35,551 --> 01:53:39,806
I'm considering a complete restructuring

1397
01:53:39,831 --> 01:53:42,717
of Danzo's Foundation and my ANBU.

1398
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:46,736
Plus we need a new Police Force.

1399
01:53:47,478 --> 01:53:50,030
Instead of sticking to one clan,

1400
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:51,939
let's have an open recruitment
for the Police Force.

1401
01:53:52,483 --> 01:53:53,995
We must think about
the Leaf Village's future,

1402
01:53:54,353 --> 01:53:57,012
and find the right person
for the right job.

1403
01:54:06,693 --> 01:54:07,798
You wanted to see me?

1404
01:54:08,537 --> 01:54:09,872
Tell me, Kakashi.

1405
01:54:10,172 --> 01:54:12,848
How many years have you been
in the ANBU?

1406
01:54:13,225 --> 01:54:17,062
I joined during the Fourth Hokage's tenure,
so... about ten years.

1407
01:54:18,241 --> 01:54:21,578
Minato's original purpose in making you
a member of the ANBU

1408
01:54:21,603 --> 01:54:25,566
was to help you deal with
the sadness in your heart.

1409
01:54:26,678 --> 01:54:29,639
He wanted to keep you close to him.

1410
01:54:30,059 --> 01:54:31,483
I kind of figured that.

1411
01:54:32,323 --> 01:54:36,460
Then Minato died, and I resumed
the position of Hokage,

1412
01:54:36,485 --> 01:54:39,196
and took Minato's ANBU
under my command.

1413
01:54:39,827 --> 01:54:46,239
But keeping you by my side
isn't going to help you.

1414
01:54:46,955 --> 01:54:48,931
In fact, I fear it has
only darkened your heart.

1415
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,738
Take off your mask.

1416
01:54:53,696 --> 01:54:55,322
Ten years...

1417
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,146
Perhaps I have asked
too much of you.

1418
01:55:02,973 --> 01:55:05,432
You are hereby relieved of
your duties as an ANBU,

1419
01:55:05,457 --> 01:55:08,168
and will assume a new position.

1420
01:55:08,452 --> 01:55:09,034
Yes, sir!

1421
01:55:09,645 --> 01:55:11,689
You will be a Jonin squad leader!

1422
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:14,673
Huh?!
