1
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,492
Genjutsu?

2
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:35,516
You're gonna teach me genjutsu, Pervy Sage?!

3
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:39,362
To be exact, I'm going to teach you
how to break a genjutsu.

4
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:42,490
How to break... a genjutsu...?

5
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:44,534
Listen up, Naruto.

6
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:47,839
There's a trick to breaking out of a
genjutsu if you get caught in one...

7
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:49,037
Pervy Sage.

8
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,006
You should know that trick very well...

9
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,673
Hey, Pervy Sage!

10
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:53,532
What?!

11
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:56,281
I want to know about
how to cast a genjutsu,

12
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,882
not how to break out of one!

13
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:00,863
Huh?

14
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,390
Wh-What's up with that reaction?!

15
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,908
Listen up, Naruto...

16
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:13,855
A genjutsu works on
an opponent's five senses.

17
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:18,661
You can control the chakra flowing
through their cerebral nervous system.

18
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,237
It's a type of jutsu that requires
a high level of intelligence.

19
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:25,075
Hmm... I don't really get it...

20
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,618
I didn't think so...

21
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:32,874
Nobody is telling you to
master genjutsu.

22
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:38,129
You're not the genjutsu type
to begin with...

23
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:39,756
Huh? Really?

24
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,762
Then forget about genjutsu!

25
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,592
Let's get to the next training!
The next training!

26
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,141
That won't do!

27
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,102
Why not?!

28
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:55,396
Some enemies use genjutsu,
after all.

29
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:58,942
For example, Itachi Uchiha!

30
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,591
Come to think of it,

31
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:09,744
even Kakashi-sensei
was beaten by his technique...

32
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:14,624
That's why you need to know
how to deal with genjutsu!

33
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:20,063
Fine.

34
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:28,489
The enemy takes control of
your inner chakra. That is genjutsu.

35
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:34,041
If you can create a disturbance
within your own chakra,

36
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,476
the genjutsu itself cannot work.

37
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,291
I don't know if
I can do such a thing.

38
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:44,239
You've already had experience doing it.

39
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,380
Huh? I did?

40
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,217
During your Rasengan training,

41
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:52,413
you learned to release chakra
and rotate it in your palms.

42
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,734
<i>All right! Just watch me!</i>

43
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:10,446
So, that's it?

44
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,591
Yes. Instead of releasing chakra
into your palms,

45
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,743
you disrupt it inside your body.

46
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,138
That's easy.

47
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,537
All right then.
Let's get some real practice!

48
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,328
Huh?!

49
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:25,393
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

50
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,134
Oh, if it isn't Jiraiya Honey!

51
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,899
Thanks for coming all this way, Gamariki.

52
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:41,414
Oh come on, no need to be so polite.

53
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,275
I-I can't breathe.

54
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,321
Oh, who is this cute boy?

55
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,014
He's Naruto.

56
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,111
Huh?! What is this guy?!

57
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,280
Hello, Naruto boy.

58
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,616
He's kinda creepy.

59
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,287
I have a favor to ask,
Mr. Gamariki.

60
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:04,625
I want you to teach him
how to break a genjutsu.

61
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,296
What should I do?

62
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,966
Well, since none other than
Jiraiya Honey is asking me.

63
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,756
- Naruto! Come on, you must ask him too!
- H-Hey, stop it! What're you doing?

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,555
So cute!

65
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,254
Let's train right away, Naruto boy!

66
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,911
What?!

67
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,509
I'll be very gentle.

68
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,028
What is this place?

69
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:38,388
Where exactly am I?

70
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:39,714
Huh?

71
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:41,162
Pervy Sage?

72
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,331
Hey, Pervy Sage!

73
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,045
What the hell is this?!

74
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:51,898
You're in my genjutsu world, my boy.

75
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:52,924
D-Don't come near me.

76
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,934
I'm not letting you escape!

77
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,067
I've gotta break this genjutsu fast
and get out of here!

78
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,192
<i>Let's see...</i>

79
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:17,095
<i>Disrupt the chakra inside my body.</i>

80
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:25,540
These dumplings are awfully good.

81
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:26,594
Oh?

82
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:34,071
Jeez! What are you releasing?

83
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:37,057
I told you,
disrupt the chakra inside you!

84
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,229
No!

85
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,335
You fool!

86
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:53,644
<i>Release!</i>

87
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,616
Huh? What happened?

88
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:05,304
You tried to disrupt chakra
inside the genjutsu world,

89
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,820
but in reality, you released it
outward and it exploded.

90
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,441
Oh, I failed then.

91
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,606
This means it's back
to basic chakra control,

92
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,966
rather than actual combat training.

93
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,671
I don't think Naruto boy
and I are compatible.

94
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,732
<i>Disrupt inside my body.</i>

95
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,235
Once more!

96
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,988
This is harder than
doing the Rasengan.

97
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,525
<i>Rotate it inside my body.</i>

98
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,287
Yes! That's the way!

99
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,287
You keep releasing it.

100
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,640
You've got a ways to go.

101
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,313
I can't do anymore...

102
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,222
My head feels like it's boiling!

103
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,531
Yeah... Everyone feels that at first.

104
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:10,798
But once you overcome it,
you will find the true secret ninjutsu:

105
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,428
the bond that ties our three families
together.

106
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,726
Then even Shikamaru and Choji are...?

107
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,140
No way...

108
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,251
There's no way those two
are training this hard.

109
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:26,020
The recent incident with Sasuke
wounded everyone badly...

110
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,453
in both body and spirit.

111
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,004
But because of that,
we will grow.

112
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:34,504
Without a doubt,
it will take several years

113
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,925
to master the secret ninjutsu,
even if you continue training.

114
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:41,400
However... it's so you can
keep up with them...

115
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:43,132
and in order to protect

116
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,649
the Ino-Shika-Cho tradition,
as well as our own...

117
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:48,760
That's why I must pass on
our secret ninjutsu to you.

118
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:54,162
That's why I was really happy
when you came

119
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,144
and asked me to train you.

120
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:58,981
W-Wait a sec...

121
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,754
Did you just say it would take
several years to master it?

122
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,380
Hmm?

123
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,251
There's no shortcut
to this training.

124
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:08,306
But I believe that you can
see this through...

125
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:11,205
O-Oh right! I just remembered
I have something to do!

126
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,523
I'm not finished talking to you!

127
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:15,340
In fact, have you forgotten
the meaning

128
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,867
behind those piercings?

129
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,223
The oath you took when Sarutobi
presented them to you?

130
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,416
That you will keep that vow,

131
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,860
and pass on new piercings
to the next generation.

132
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,336
You will eventually lead
the Yamanaka Clan...

133
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,055
and entrust a new earring to
your child who will be born.

134
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,582
<i>Not this story again...</i>

135
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,453
O-Oh, that's right!

136
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,944
Choji's being discharged today!

137
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:38,679
What? Choji is?

138
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:42,230
I have to get a present and
get things ready, so I have to go!

139
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,059
I-I see. I guess
it can't be helped then.

140
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,711
Yeah... See you later.

141
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:58,135
<i>Several years?
You've got to be kidding me!</i>

142
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:03,671
<i>I just wanted to quickly get stronger
and show those guys!</i>

143
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,260
<i>What's the point if
it takes so many years?</i>

144
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,089
Sakura!

145
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,291
Ino!

146
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,187
We're celebrating Choji's discharge
from the hospital.

147
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,730
Want to join us?

148
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:21,567
Oh... Choji's well enough to leave?

149
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:23,214
That's great news!

150
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,707
But I'm sorry!

151
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:26,536
I'm in the middle of training.

152
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,377
Please congratulate Choji for me!

153
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:34,706
Huh? Where's Shikamaru?

154
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:37,731
He's seeing off the Sand ninja.

155
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,147
Thank you for the food!

156
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:44,008
Only the three of us here
to celebrate is pretty lame.

157
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:47,808
Hey, Asuma-sensei...
So does that mean I can eat the rest?

158
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,902
Hey Choji, I heard all about it!

159
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:56,437
How you were flirting with
all the nurses!

160
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:02,166
Ino... I'm going to tell you
the one truth about men.

161
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,404
There isn't a man alive who
doesn't go crazy over nurses!

162
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,594
Right, Asuma-sensei?

163
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,219
Hmm? Y-Yeah, I guess...

164
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,453
What kind of nonsense is that?

165
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,266
Asuma-sensei only has eyes
for Kurenai-sensei!

166
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,342
Huh? Is that true?

167
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,773
I'd like three more orders
of the special beef fillet!

168
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:23,881
Right now!

169
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,214
Score!

170
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,149
But...

171
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,302
<i>Open wide, Sasuke!</i>

172
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,890
<i>Thank you, Ino. I owe you my life!</i>

173
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,335
That might work...

174
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:47,729
Why am I feeding you?!

175
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,504
I never refuse food
that's offered to me.

176
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,697
That's my Ninja Way!

177
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:53,329
Another helping please!

178
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,739
Right when you were discharged,
you were still skinny.

179
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,833
That sure didn't last long.

180
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:05,301
With that kind of appetite,
I'd say you're back to normal.

181
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:09,359
When I'm done eating,
can you help me train, Asuma-sensei?

182
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:11,518
Hey! Are you stupid?

183
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,090
You just got better!

184
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:19,435
Man, everyone's so stuck
on training...

185
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,527
How come you're so eager
to get back to training, Choji?

186
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,751
For starters,
I want to catch up to Shikamaru

187
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,736
who beat me to becoming a Chunin.

188
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,133
After all, together
we're the Ino-Shika-Cho trio.

189
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:34,320
Do your best too! Okay, Ino?

190
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,820
I don't need you to tell me that.

191
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:44,688
All right!

192
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,304
Don't get too confident because
of one or two successes.

193
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:52,676
You have to become faster
and more efficient.

194
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:55,638
No one waits for treatment
on the battlefield.

195
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:56,603
Yes!

196
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:13,656
Who's there?

197
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:23,541
Lady Tsunade!

198
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,584
Please make me your apprentice!

199
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:29,135
You belong to the Yamanaka Clan...

200
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:36,611
Sakura was able to revive
that in three months.

201
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,474
I'll test you... and see how far
you get in three months.

202
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,898
I understand. Please let me try!

203
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,535
This thing?

204
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:56,053
Usually, the way to resuscitate
a creature that has asphyxiated

205
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,915
is to stimulate the heart
or brain with chakra.

206
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:05,038
Octopi generally have one systemic heart
and two branchial hearts.

207
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,109
And separate from the brain,

208
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,635
they have eight nervous systems
in their arms.

209
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:14,940
It has many organs vital
to resuscitation.

210
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,587
In other words,

211
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,664
it has a lot of parts that need
to be taken care of.

212
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,716
Oh...

213
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,956
You can quit if you don't like it!

214
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:26,715
And you, Sakura! You are completely
deficient in the knowledge of healing!

215
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:29,982
I have to learn... all of this?!

216
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,906
You can quit if you don't like it!

217
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,425
That happens because
your chakra control is too rough.

218
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:12,626
You have to fine-tune your method,

219
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,735
or you'll rip the octopus apart.

220
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,633
Control your chakra more delicately!

221
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,064
Y-Yes!

222
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:22,439
<i>She's having a hard time.</i>

223
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,641
<i>She's made some mistakes,
but in this short time, she's...</i>

224
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:48,009
Sasuke said he was going to
sever his bond with me

225
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,411
and become stronger.

226
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,817
He said I could never understand
his feelings.

227
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,633
You were friends with Orochimaru
long ago, right, Pervy Sage?

228
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,888
Why did Orochimaru desert the village

229
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:05,832
and decide to destroy the Leaf?

230
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:12,007
Orochimaru changed after
his parents were killed.

231
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:15,546
He became obsessed with
the Forbidden Jutsu.

232
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,591
Maybe he longed to see his parents...

233
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,732
Or maybe he sought revenge
on the Leaf,

234
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,834
who he held responsible
for their deaths.

235
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,242
My parents weren't killed.

236
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,769
So like you,

237
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,637
I was accused of not being
able to understand.

238
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,184
Perhaps he was right,

239
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,942
and I didn't understand
a thing about him...

240
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:46,424
However...

241
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:52,291
Even I can see there's too much hate
in our ninja world.

242
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,100
Hate?

243
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,689
And I've wanted to do something
about this hatred,

244
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:01,759
yet I'm not sure what must be done.

245
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,039
But I have faith...

246
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:06,613
that there will come a time

247
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,266
when people can truly understand
one another.

248
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,895
It all sounds kinda complicated.

249
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:15,831
And if I can't find the answer,

250
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:19,151
perhaps I'll entrust you to find it.

251
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:23,135
Yes, sir! I can't turn you down,
can I, Pervy Sage?

252
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:28,183
What? Why are you laughing?

253
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,128
Your smile is my salvation.

254
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:36,290
I'm glad I made you my student.

255
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:37,911
R-Really?

256
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:42,007
But I haven't given up yet.

257
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,179
I'm going to change the world
with my books!

258
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,681
With those books that don't sell?

259
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,128
You fool!

260
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,868
They'll be bestsellers before
you know it!

261
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,645
And when that day finally arrives,

262
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,731
I won't autograph your copies
even if you beg me!

263
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,741
I don't need any of that!

264
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,457
<i>Well... We have lots of time.</i>

265
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,012
Pervy Sage.

266
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:32,871
Let's call it a day.

267
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,355
Here. Eat.

268
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,813
<i>Say! Say! Why did you choose me?</i>

269
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:51,148
<i>I guess when it comes to
amazing sage jutsu,</i>

270
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,508
<i>only someone with my level
of talent can inherit it, right?</i>

271
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:59,042
<i>Long ago, I taught the Fourth Hokage.</i>

272
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,814
<i>And you have an uncanny
resemblance to him.</i>

273
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,130
<i>I guess that's the only reason.</i>

274
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:09,553
<i>I resemble the Fourth Hokage?</i>

275
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,096
Good! I guess we can move on
to the next step in training.

276
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:23,035
– I'll never lose to you!
– I'll never lose to you!

277
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,396
It's three months today.

278
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,367
Try it, Ino.

279
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:22,190
Yes!

280
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:47,892
You did it!

281
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,088
H-Hey, Sakura!

282
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:56,261
You took too long, and made
a lot of pointless errors.

283
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:59,698
While it took me three months too,
I was able to complete it more smoothly.

284
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,057
Shut up!

285
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,244
You broke my concentration since
you kept peeking over at me!

286
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:05,810
What did you say?!

287
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:06,836
What yourself!

288
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,246
You pass!

289
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:23,832
What made you start
learning medical ninjutsu?

290
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,548
Huh?

291
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:31,338
I wanted to create...
a place where I belong.

292
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:35,001
Naruto...

293
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:41,002
Naruto kept his promise
to me and got beat up.

294
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,843
He acted reckless
all because of me...

295
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:47,752
I was always in the back,
following them...

296
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,499
But I'm a member of the team too.

297
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,928
I wanted to walk
shoulder to shoulder with them.

298
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,962
So I promised myself...

299
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,184
That from now on, I would.

300
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:07,654
<i>It's so you can keep up with them...</i>

301
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,496
<i>... and in order to protect</i>

302
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,907
<i>the Ino-Shika-Cho tradition,
as well as our own...</i>

303
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:15,241
<i>That's why I must pass on
our secret ninjutsu to you.</i>

304
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:19,114
<i>After all, together
we're the Ino-Shika-Cho trio.</i>

305
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,038
<i>Do your best too! Okay, Ino?</i>

306
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:27,561
<i>Team 10 is where I belong.</i>

307
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,939
<i>And... I also want to walk
shoulder to shoulder with them.</i>

308
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:33,649
<i>But...</i>

309
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:35,621
<i>Without a doubt,</i>

310
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:38,524
<i>it will take several years to
master the secret ninjutsu.</i>

311
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:45,451
<i>Maybe I was running away
and taking the easy way out...</i>

312
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,543
Hey, those wounds!

313
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,005
Oh, I must have scraped it earlier.

314
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,224
– This is nothing.
– That's not good!

315
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:01,380
Ino...

316
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,540
Thanks, Sakura...

317
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:09,231
I'm going back to
the place where I belong...

318
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,944
Say, say. Why are we changing
locations to practice?

319
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:19,480
Is there a decent genjutsu master
some place else?

320
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:24,251
A sea of forest surrounds
the village where we are headed.

321
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:27,965
A special magnetic field exists
in that area

322
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,229
that affects a person's chakra flow
in the brain.

323
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:33,326
If anyone traveling through
the region takes the wrong path,

324
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:37,267
he could end up in a situation
similar to being under a genjutsu.

325
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:41,632
It's the perfect location to
wrap up your genjutsu training.

326
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,865
Wow! Sounds like fun!

327
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,020
All right! Let's do it!

328
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:54,424
Pervy Sage! When are we gonna
reach this village?

329
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,193
We're almost there.

330
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:58,944
Huh? I don't see a thing.

331
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,943
If you wander,
you'll end up in a genjutsu.

332
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:06,368
Oww! Jeez, what the heck?

333
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,337
What's this?

334
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:17,240
I don't know! There was nothing like
this the last time I came.

335
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:20,513
Hey!

336
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:24,736
Chili pepper? That's powerful.

337
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,745
Go away!

338
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,238
What's the big idea?!

339
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,878
We're not enemies.

340
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:33,810
Huh?

341
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,699
Aren't you Tanishi?

342
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:40,043
t's me, Jiraiya. Your parents
showed me great hospitality

343
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,137
when I last visited here to
do research for my novel.

344
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:43,049
What?!

345
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:44,818
You're Tanishi, after all.

346
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:47,946
I remember that mole
on your forehead.

347
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:51,342
What's going on?
You know this kid, Pervy Sage?

348
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,240
How are Sukune and Yone?

349
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,111
Shut up!
Don't come near here!

350
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:00,106
No one can come near this village!

351
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:01,481
Why not?

352
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:02,385
Shut up!

353
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,486
What's wrong, Tanishi?

354
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:06,729
Did something happen?

355
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,021
Hurry and go!

356
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,868
There'll be trouble if they see you!

357
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,459
Hey! What's going on?

358
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:15,235
Let's take our leave for now, Naruto.

359
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:24,338
Jeez, what's up with that?

360
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:27,811
It was a peaceful village
when I last came here.

361
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,651
But something made those
once friendly villagers put up a wall

362
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:36,139
to keep strangers out,
and even arm themselves.

363
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:41,424
<i>This isn't something
we can simply ignore.</i>

364
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:43,617
I'll take over guard duty.

365
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:44,450
Thanks.

366
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,824
There are two suspicious individuals
hanging around.

367
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:49,888
Be careful.

368
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:51,121
Got it.

369
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:58,029
You must be tired
from all-night guard duty.

370
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,059
Go and get some rest, Tanishi.

371
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:01,233
Yeah.

372
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,330
Don't make any noise.

373
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,522
We just want to help.

374
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:17,060
Tell me what's going on in the village.

375
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,980
Okay...

376
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,518
Okay, just put that down.

377
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:27,999
Sorry. But I didn't want to
start a commotion.

378
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,620
Where is Sukune?

379
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,241
Please leave.

380
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:36,426
If they find out you're in the village,
the other villagers will get killed.

381
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:39,172
What do you mean?

382
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:48,540
We've come to borrow
the power of this area.

383
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:52,233
In order to perfect our genjutsu!

384
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:59,959
Your villagers can live inside
my genjutsu.

385
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,423
Mom!

386
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:15,515
Dad!

387
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,462
Our village has been protected
by illusions

388
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,259
and we have lived in harmony
with them.

389
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,282
We discovered a way to
get out of illusions

390
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:29,643
using these red balls made
from chili peppers.

391
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:31,933
Don't worry, everyone!

392
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:35,817
I, Sukune, promise to protect you!

393
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:39,789
You guys!

394
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,083
Get out of our village!

395
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:45,513
It would be smarter to help me.

396
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:49,097
The illusions made by the trees

397
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:51,920
are blessings from the gods
to protect our village!

398
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:54,636
They are not for your protection!

399
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:57,324
He's right! Get out!
Get out!

400
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:01,149
<i>Change!</i>

401
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:08,648
What?

402
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,335
Starting now I, Kandachi,
will rule this village.

403
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,346
The women and children
are hostages!

404
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,538
If any word about us
leaks out of the village,

405
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:23,440
consider the hostages dead!

406
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:24,857
Don't be ridiculous!

407
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,200
As if we'd let you have
your way with us!

408
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:32,300
Dad!

409
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:35,632
This is nothing.

410
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:44,155
Defying me is useless.

411
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,163
Dad, stop!

412
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,325
Don't fight anymore!

413
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:04,922
This village...

414
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:08,169
Don't be stupid! Stop!

415
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,354
Does not belong to you!

416
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,387
Stop!

417
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:23,531
Dad was murdered.

418
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,856
The women and children
were taken hostage.

419
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,130
So there's no way
the men can fight back.

420
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,431
So that's what happened...

421
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:35,771
Your dad was a great man.

422
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:37,851
Shut up! Dad was a fool.

423
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,509
What are you saying?

424
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,420
He's a brave man who tried
to save the village!

425
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:45,181
I'm not going to be a fool like him!

426
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:49,043
He threw his life away fighting
someone he couldn't possibly beat!

427
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:50,663
Hey, you.

428
00:30:52,946 --> 00:30:55,121
If we don't do a thing,
we won't get killed.

429
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:57,036
That's our only option!

430
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,137
So please...

431
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,865
Don't do anything more.

432
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,297
Just leave before those guys find you!

433
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:05,111
And you call yourself-

434
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:06,137
Understood!

435
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,132
Pervy Sage?!

436
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,116
Then you'll leave?!

437
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:11,025
Forgive me.

438
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,624
I can understand his reasons,

439
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:18,941
but I can't just leave
the villagers I'm indebted to.

440
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:20,626
That's more like it!

441
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:29,024
Tanishi?!

442
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:35,330
Tanishi! Is he one of the two
suspicious men you mentioned?

443
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,845
Damn right, he--
I mean, yes, he is.

444
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,783
And they call me the Great Jiraiya...

445
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:43,526
I was so careless.

446
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,087
Let's take him to Lord Kandachi
right away.

447
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:47,301
Yeah.

448
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:50,141
The other one should be
wandering around nearby.

449
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:52,529
So stay on the lookout here.

450
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,791
- Right.
- Right.

451
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,925
That island is...

452
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:10,238
Looks like the hostages are
being kept there.

453
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,838
Lord Kandachi!

454
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:28,241
It appears our real enemy is finally
making his appearance.

455
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,404
Lord Kandachi...

456
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:43,032
We captured the suspicious fellow
who trespassed into our village.

457
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:49,205
Kid, did you catch him?

458
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,373
Y-Yes, sir.

459
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:56,654
You actually caught Jiraiya,

460
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:58,159
one of the Sannin of the Hidden Leaf?

461
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:01,229
Oh? I know that ugly mug.

462
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:05,272
You're Kandachi, Hanzo the Salamander's
right-hand man!

463
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,428
What a place to run into you.

464
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,288
Don't tell me you deserted your village?

465
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,793
The Village Hidden in the Rain
has no leader anymore.

466
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,829
In fact, it's no longer our village.

467
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:18,079
Oh?

468
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:20,838
If we hadn't hidden ourselves,

469
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,835
we'd probably have been killed
as rebels too.

470
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:29,097
Kid! You'll be rewarded for
bringing Jiraiya here.

471
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,042
Tell me what you want.

472
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,434
He's not me! He's a fake!

473
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:38,256
Huh?!

474
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,231
T-Two Tanishis?! What's going on?

475
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,217
Who are you?!

476
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,542
Why did you have to show up now,
of all times?!

477
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,620
You're...

478
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:54,822
Yup... I figured as much.

479
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,941
Kid, you let Jiraiya enter
the village, didn't you?

480
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,942
Huh?!

481
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,228
You're gonna pay
a hefty price for that.

482
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:12,727
Mom!

483
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,957
W-What are you going to do?!

484
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,549
I'm gonna keep my promise!

485
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:22,423
And feed your friends
to the Conch King!

486
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,165
My word...

487
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,675
<i>Ninja Art: Conch Whip!</i>

488
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,123
Stop! Please stop!

489
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,903
Damn him!

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,453
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

491
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,521
What an unusual jutsu you use.

492
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:04,127
Here I come!

00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:06,803

494
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,489
What?!

495
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,701
Naruto!

496
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,824
That's why I told you
to stay out of this!

497
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:23,027
I beg you! Please spare the lives
of my village friends!

498
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:25,069
Not likely.

499
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,780
Because I made you a promise.

500
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:35,296
Please! Please spare everyone.

501
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:39,102
Tanishi...

502
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:42,730
You're asking the wrong person.

503
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,228
It made no difference whether
we came or not.

504
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:50,751
Do you really believe that
he'll release the hostages one day?

505
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,078
Remember your father Sukune!

506
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:58,463
Think about why he chose to fight!

507
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,805
If you keep believing that your father
died a senseless death,

508
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,934
this village will never be saved!

509
00:36:08,722 --> 00:36:11,350
Pervy Sage! Get everyone
out of the cages!

510
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:13,531
Right, leave it to me!

511
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:20,344
I don't think so!

512
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:25,600
Whoa!

513
00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:31,954

You're still coming at me?

You're a fool who doesn't know
how weak you are.

520
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:58,441
Shut up!

521
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,627
I can't sit still until I pulverize
cowards like you!

522
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,940
You're a glutton for punishment.

Nope, not yet.

00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:37,036

00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:20,656
No, not yet.

535
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,173
Why?

536
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:28,784
Why?!

537
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:36,755
<i>This village... does not
belong to you!</i>

538
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,346
Why?!

539
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,444
Desperately charging at a foe
you have no chance of beating.

540
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,530
You are such a fool.

541
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:58,407
Yeah... If that's what fools do,
I'm a fool.

542
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:03,145
I'm a super-fool who never gives up
once I've made up my mind!

543
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:07,776
<i>If you keep believing that
your father died a senseless death,</i>

544
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,220
<i>this village will never be saved!</i>

545
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:14,315
Damn... Damn... Damn!

546
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:16,426
H-Hey...

547
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:20,622
I... I... I...

548
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:24,810
Tanishi, get everyone to safety!

549
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,936
You can do that much, can't you?

550
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:31,129
I'm going to beat that guy!

551
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:33,603
What are you doing? Hurry, go!

552
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:34,927
O-Okay.

553
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:39,543
Tanishi, what are you going to do?!

554
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:40,933
I'm going to save everyone!

555
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,333
You're going to defy Lord Kandachi?!

556
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:47,134
Obeying him only meant
he kept us alive.

557
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,533
Now you're talking! Spoken like
a true son of Sukune!

558
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,232
I'll leave the rest to you!

559
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,062
Right!

560
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,029
Okay, everyone.

561
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,924
I'll let you out now!

562
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:13,487
Jeez, don't blame me
if things get worse!

563
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:17,700
Ready, pull!

564
00:40:18,774 --> 00:40:21,072
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kandachi.

565
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:24,929
I thought I could kill some time
with this kid, but I guess not.

566
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,732
How are you doing, Naruto?!

567
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:35,241
Oh... I've got lots left in me.

568
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:43,165
Hurry, this way!

569
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:53,680
<i>Ninja Art: Needle Jizo!</i>

570
00:40:58,972 --> 00:40:59,711
What?!

571
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:04,538
I'll back you up.
Finish him off, Naruto!

572
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:07,131
Time for your payback.

573
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:07,976
Right!

574
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:11,254
There's no way he can beat me.

575
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:15,564
So both of you are fools, eh?
Well then...

576
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,932
I'll take care of both of you
with this jutsu!

577
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:22,032
<i>Water Style Genjutsu:
Mystic Fog Prison!</i>

578
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:32,436
What is that?

579
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,651
W-What?

580
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:50,422
Pervy Sage?! What's going on?

581
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:55,730
Damn it!

582
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,372
<i>M-My hand...</i>

583
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,842
You can't weave signs, can you?

584
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:06,916
<i>I-It's no good.</i>

585
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:11,225
<i>I can't move my body at all.</i>

586
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:16,772
We're almost there.
Hurry, everyone.

587
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,424
What happened to them?

588
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,928
Lord Kandachi...

589
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:37,071
They were touched by the breath
of the Conch King

590
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,433
and are under a genjutsu.

591
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:40,427
We'll finish them off.

592
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:42,339
Take it easy.

593
00:42:42,982 --> 00:42:43,643
But...

594
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,052
We chose this site because
the special magnetic field

595
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:50,109
created by the trees surrounding
this swamp

596
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,719
greatly increases
the genjutsu power of the Conch King.

597
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:59,126
Even someone like Jiraiya
cannot break this genjutsu.

598
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,825
These two will be overcome
by fear due to their paralysis.

599
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:08,420
It's just a matter of time before
they have a mental breakdown.

600
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,830
<i>Damn... I can't move.</i>

601
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:20,433
Instead, go and get the runaway villagers!

602
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:21,287
Yes sir!

603
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,427
They won't find you here.

604
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:33,515
Stay put until I come back.

605
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,042
But where are you going, Tanishi?

606
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:37,640
You're not going out there!

607
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:39,509
You'll be killed this time!

608
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,640
I finally understand...

609
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,234
that you can't just keep running away.

610
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:47,529
But against those monsters?!
Don't be a fool!

611
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:48,938
A fool?

612
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:54,446
<i>I'm a giant fool who never gives up
once my mind is made up!</i>

613
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:57,626
Yeah... So I'm a fool.

614
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,138
<i>If I went against my word,
I wouldn't be who I am.</i>

615
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,626
That Hidden Leaf fellow taught me.

616
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,217
Dad probably felt the same way.

617
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:11,135
If we just do whatever
they tell us to do,

618
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,837
we'll lose sight of ourselves.

619
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,141
Well said, Tanishi!

620
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:16,621
Mom!

621
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,561
You're Sukune's son, after all!

622
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:22,299
Please look after the others!

623
00:44:22,446 --> 00:44:23,132
You bet!

624
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,526
Be careful.

625
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:26,630
Yeah!

626
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:40,743
W-What happened?!

627
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:44,545
We were caught inside
a genjutsu until now.

628
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:51,777
Naruto, it's a chili pepper ball.

629
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:53,262
Close your eyes!

630
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:54,863
Impossible...

631
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:56,573
They broke out of the genjutsu?!

632
00:44:57,073 --> 00:44:58,450
H-Hot...

633
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:02,729
Naruto, wake up!

634
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:04,248
Y-You?!

635
00:45:04,516 --> 00:45:06,038
Why didn't you run away?!

636
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:09,649
I decided to become a big fool like you!

637
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:12,139
That's great!

638
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:14,433
Now leave the rest to me!

639
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:20,389
Then you take care of
the big one by yourself.

640
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:21,134
Huh?!

641
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:24,039
A shadow clone?!

642
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:25,418
What?!

643
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:27,636
How did you escape my genjutsu?!

644
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:29,534
You see...

645
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:34,232
It was just a clone that fell
under your genjutsu.

646
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:35,501
Pervy Sage!

647
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:38,859
Naruto! Do you have any chakra left?

648
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:41,935
Yeah! I have loads and loads of it.

649
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:44,747
Then we'll start with the big one!

650
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:48,442
But Rasengan won't work on him!

651
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:51,119
That was a failed attempt.

652
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:52,780
Remember your training.

653
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:57,159
You should be able to release
a huge Rasengan,

654
00:45:57,184 --> 00:45:59,537
like the one you created that
sent Gamariki flying!

655
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:00,964
I get it!

656
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,018
All right!
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

657
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,133
Here we go!

658
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:08,065
Right!

659
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:14,932
Hey, are you serious?

660
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,635
That jutsu won't work
on the Conch King.

661
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,934
<i>All right...</i>

662
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:26,059
<i>Just like the last time,
but outside my body.</i>

663
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,370
You don't know when to give up,
do you, fool?!

664
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,854
I'll get you first!

665
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,586
Well? How's it coming along?!

666
00:46:57,795 --> 00:47:00,629
Just a little more.
Give me a little more time!

667
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,003
All right! I'll confine it!

668
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:04,914
<i>Ninja Art: Raging Lion's Mane!</i>

669
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:18,522
How long do you think
you can hang on?

670
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:21,353
<i>Hurry!</i>

671
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:30,730
Getting tired, eh?

672
00:47:35,382 --> 00:47:36,633
<i>Naruto...</i>

673
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:39,924
What? What is that?!

674
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,636
Pervy Sage!

675
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:48,611
Right!

676
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:50,834
Damn it!

677
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:53,317
Repel him!

678
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:05,724
Here I go!

679
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,716
<i>Giant Rasengan!</i>

680
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:39,196
Well done!

681
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:48,351
Why?! Why'd you take hostages
and try to rule over the village?

682
00:48:48,811 --> 00:48:51,939
You could have asked the village
to hide you guys!

683
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,770
Like I'd trust strangers.

684
00:48:57,795 --> 00:49:01,518
I am Kandachi of the Rain.
And I am no fool.

685
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:05,318
If you had been one,
things would've been much easier!

686
00:49:11,526 --> 00:49:12,284
We did it.

687
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:20,415
Dad, the village is at peace again.

688
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:26,528
The power of the trees
will protect us again.

689
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:28,112
Dad...

690
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:33,916
I'll protect Mom and the village,
just like you did, Dad.

691
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:35,248
I promise.

692
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:39,543
Since we found out,

693
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,017
I doubt that those Hidden Rain fellows
will return to this village.

694
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:49,057
I've been able to repay Sukune
for his hospitality.

695
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:54,647
Thank you so much.

696
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,423
We're the ones who should
be thanking you.

697
00:49:57,863 --> 00:50:00,405
If Tanishi hadn't come that time,

698
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,834
we'd have been finished off
in that genjutsu.

699
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:05,750
You're probably right.

700
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:06,643
Oww!

701
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,421
He gets so carried away!

702
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,029
Such a fool, this one.

703
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,224
<i>Minato...</i>

704
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,439
<i>Naruto has grown up.</i>

705
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:38,430
<i>Far better than I imagined.</i>

706
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:44,435
<i>He's just as gutsy and tenacious
as the both of us.</i>

707
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:49,937
<i>You were more than a teacher.
You were like a father to me.</i>

708
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:54,212
<i>Sensei, I know he too will
love you like family.</i>

709
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:59,643
Then I guess that makes Naruto my grandson.

710
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:04,126
What're you muttering about, Pervy Sage?

711
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,840
Oh, nothing. A grandson like you...

712
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:11,534
A grandson like me? What the hell?!

713
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:13,532
Are you going senile?!

714
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:17,596
Now, now, don't say that
and come closer, grandson!

715
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:21,839
What? That's creepy! Cut it out!

716
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:23,828
Get away from me, Pervy Sage!

717
00:51:23,853 --> 00:51:25,688
Aw... Don't say that.

718
00:51:25,713 --> 00:51:28,346
Then I say I'll go this way,
and you can go that way, Pervy Sage!

719
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:51,740
<i>Are you all right? Rin...? Kakashi...?</i>

720
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:55,383
<i>I don't think... I can make it...</i>

721
00:51:58,002 --> 00:51:58,922
<i>Kakashi...</i>

722
00:52:02,476 --> 00:52:04,441
Obito... Rin...

723
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:08,138
I wasn't able to protect either of you.

724
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,733
But I will protect
the Hidden Leaf Village...

725
00:52:12,758 --> 00:52:14,034
no matter what.
