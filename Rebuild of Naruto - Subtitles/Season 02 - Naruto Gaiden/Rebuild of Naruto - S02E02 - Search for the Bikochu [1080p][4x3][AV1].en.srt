1
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,410
All right!

2
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,810
I can start my training!

3
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:22,602
<i>For now, this is all I can do.
I can't afford to fail!</i>

4
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:32,735
What's up?

5
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,572
Going to all the trouble of coming
to pick me up like this...

6
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,669
You're on your way to Kurenai-sensei's
after this anyway, right...?

7
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,956
Taking the time to talk
once in a while...

8
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,042
that's also part of teamwork.

9
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,922
Let me hear about your mission.

10
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,201
It was pretty intense...

11
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,003
But you wouldn't understand
even if I explained it to you.

12
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>I don't want Akamaru to experience
that kind of thing ever again.</i>

13
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,936
<i>And for that, I have to hone
my jutsu even more...</i>

14
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,243
I want to hear about it in detail.

15
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:13,847
Because that's what teamwork
is about.

16
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,105
Are you sulking...

17
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,674
because you were the only one left out?

18
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,119
<i>You are sulking, aren't you?</i>

19
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,814
<i>I still have a long way to go...</i>

20
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:35,492
<i>Until I can see his moves...</i>

21
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,755
I can't believe you're doing
that this early in the morning...

22
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,275
Neji, let's take a break.

23
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:55,147
Okay!

24
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:57,291
- Let's go, Hinata!
- Okay!

25
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,898
Father, see you later.

26
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,418
BBQ? This early in the morning?

27
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,979
Just when he was looking good
after losing some weight

28
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,673
since he got out of the hospital.

29
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:19,472
He gained it all back in an amazing
rebound, didn't he?

30
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,898
With that good an appetite,

31
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,393
there aren't any more worries
about his health, are there?

32
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:28,818
When I'm done eating,
help me with my training, okay?

33
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,155
Asuma-sensei!

34
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,454
Hey, are you an idiot
or something?!

35
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,399
You're recuperating, you know!

36
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,713
L-Lee... Come on,
let's take a short break...

37
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,398
What's the matter, Guy-sensei?

38
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,410
The prime of one's youth waits
for no one, you know.

39
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,004
Maintaining the prime of one's youth
is starting to get tough...

40
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,977
Thank you very much!

41
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,159
Do your best, guys...

42
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:30,330
I'll master Shuriken Jutsu
by the next time you're here!

43
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,461
M-Me too...

44
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:37,086
I want to be a great kunoichi
just like you, Temari.

45
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,396
I'm honored.

46
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,051
I apologize for asking you
to teach at the Academy...

47
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,303
since we're so short-staffed right now.

48
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:47,803
You probably would've preferred
to go sightseeing or something.

49
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,748
No problem.
I'm doing this because I enjoy it.

50
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,939
Yeah... And we were
also able to survey

51
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:57,403
the Leafâ€™s growing military strength
in the years ahead.

52
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,906
Well, be careful going home.

53
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,011
Okay...

54
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:10,411
If something happens,
I'll come to your rescue again.

55
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,702
Just let me know, crybaby.

56
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,101
You always say too much.
That's why girls are...

57
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,840
All right! I'm ready!

58
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,693
Now I just have to wait
for Pervy Sage to show up!

59
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,302
There he is!

60
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,659
But my training...

61
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't get so pouty, Naruto.

62
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:48,066
Some work came in all of a sudden.
It can't be helped.

63
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,107
It's just gonna be doing
an interview

64
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,745
for some pervy magazine anyway, right?

65
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,408
That kind of thing isn't called work.

66
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,685
<i>It's a mission to gather
information about the Akatsuki...</i>

67
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,217
<i>But if I tell this guy that,</i>

68
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,840
<i>he might ask me to
let him come.</i>

69
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:04,805
Humph!

70
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,425
I'll make it up to you by...

71
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:08,469
Huh?

72
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,681
Wh-What's this?

73
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:16,185
It's so that you don't get bored
while you're staying at home.

74
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,855
It's a special training menu
I put together!

75
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:20,503
Wow!

76
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,080
Wait, wait!

77
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:25,797
My own prized secret training
methods are inscribed here.

78
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,699
Don't read this where
other people might see it!

79
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:30,585
Okay!

80
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,946
Well, do your best!

81
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,706
I'm gonna use this
to train vigorously!

82
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,990
Thank you, Pervy Sage!

83
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,771
Walls have ears...
and paper screens have eyes.

84
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,061
Pervy Sage's secret training methods...

85
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,057
What?!

86
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,542
Pervy Sage!

87
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,811
Huh, it's Lady Tsunade.

88
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,212
Huh? You guys are...

89
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:45,611
Hey, are you visiting someone
at the hospital too?

90
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:46,867
Yes.

91
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:48,897
You too, Lady Tsunade?

92
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,536
Well, I guess...

93
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,014
She just doesn't want to be
in her office.

94
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:54,221
Shut up!

95
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,314
Hinata, don't faint when
you see Kurenai-sensei.

96
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,510
P-Please let's not talk about that.

97
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,221
Did something happen?

98
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,462
When we were visiting Naruto
in the hospital in the past...

99
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:06,487
Shino!

100
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:10,170
This girl fainted when she saw Naruto
all covered with bandages.

101
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,004
Kiba!

102
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,556
I'll... I'll be fine this time!

103
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,088
I finally found you...!

104
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:19,622
Old Lady Tsunade, I need
to talk to you!

105
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,296
Huh? Hinata!

106
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>Naruto...</i>

107
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,904
- <i>Naruto is... so close!</i>
- Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong?

108
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,803
Your face looks a little red...

109
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,868
Do you have a fever or something? Huh?

110
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:39,662
Hey...

111
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,610
H-Hey, Hinata?!

112
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,251
Hey Hinata!

113
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,953
Are you okay?!
Get a hold of yourself!

114
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:55,132
Hinata!

115
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:57,850
Naruto...

116
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,210
Hey, you woke up.

117
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,777
I've asked you numerous times already!

118
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,242
Please, let me go look for Sasuke!

119
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,742
I've told you numerous times already.
Impossible!

120
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,384
Why!

121
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,571
You have some training to do!

122
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,172
I can't because Pervy Sage
isn't around!

123
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:29,013
We have zero leads
on Orochimaru or Sasuke.

124
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,731
So how are you planning
to search for him?

125
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,882
I can figure it out somehow!

126
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,474
If there aren't any leads,
I'll go find some!

127
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,785
So please, let me go!

128
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,598
You're stubborn, aren't you?

129
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:41,374
You're stubborn too,
Old Lady Tsunade!

130
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,284
- Please let me go!
- No, you may not!

131
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,826
If I say I'm going, I'm going!

132
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,512
Shut up! No means no!

133
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:52,834
<i>Byakugan!</i>

134
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,119
All right! Good work, Neji!

135
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,595
Move in another half step
right there!

136
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,307
Yes sir!

137
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:16,446
Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,616
Let's take a break, Neji.

139
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,185
Yes.

140
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,030
Have some tea too.

141
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,609
Thank you...

142
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:41,021
If Hinata were here, she could have
learned by observing.

143
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,286
Hinata prepared this...?

144
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:49,231
It would supplement her training
by observing...

145
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:04,537
<i>Byakugan!</i>

146
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,388
Let's take a break.

147
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:22,467
Yes.

148
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:23,686
Food! Food!

149
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:29,227
That was pretty well done.

150
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,814
I would say that you're getting closer
to perfecting the technique.

151
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,627
It's thanks to you both.

152
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,839
You're so kind to join me
in my special training every day...

153
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,498
We're a team.

154
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
When a teammate is in a jam,

155
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:42,011
one offers a helping hand.

156
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,763
That's only natural...

157
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:46,557
A teammate...

158
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:52,021
If a teammate suddenly disappears,

159
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,708
it must be awfully hard.

160
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,895
You're talking about Naruto,
aren't you?

161
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:03,866
Isn't there some way
we could help him?

162
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:08,245
I'd like to help him out in
some way too... but...

163
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,042
Lady Hokage was telling Naruto...

164
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:15,127
that there are no leads at all.

165
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,300
There may be one resource...

166
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:22,705
Really?!

167
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,426
I'm talking about bikochu.

168
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:27,973
Bikochu?

169
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,412
Are you talking about
those rare insects?!

170
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:35,064
I have heard that they had
become extinct some time ago.

171
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,751
Since there was a possibility
that they could become extinct,

172
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:40,778
the Aburame Clan discontinued
using them,

173
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,600
so a small number of them
should still exist.

174
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,197
Lady Tsunade, what are bikochu?

175
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:51,394
Well... it's not surprising that
you don't know about them.

176
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,192
The last time that bikochu
were used

177
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,582
was before the last Great War...

178
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:01,299
Bikochu are one kind of insect
used by insect handlers.

179
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,607
Larvae which have hatched from eggs
become chrysalises in no time at all,

180
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,596
then emerge as adults.

181
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,004
They are then made to
recognize scents...

182
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,977
and they are able to track
even the faintest scent...

183
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,437
to its source.

184
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:18,977
Their olfactory sense is several thousand
times greater than a Ninja Hound's.

185
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,907
They are insects capable of exhibiting
that skill in an exceptional way.

186
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:29,368
However, bikochu lay eggs
only once every several years...

187
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,967
This year is actually the year
in which they lay eggs.

188
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,624
And right now is exactly
the time when they hatch.

189
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,096
I see.

190
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,296
There are still some of
Sasuke's belongings left in the village...

191
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,300
Right?

192
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:44,004
If we have a bikochu memorize
that scent...

193
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:48,053
We may be able to locate
Sasuke's whereabouts, right?

194
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,474
What is the probability
of finding a bikochu?

195
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,646
Frankly speaking, not very high.
Perhaps 10%.

196
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,216
10% huh...

197
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,705
As you guys know,

198
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,704
the situation in the village
is currently very grave...

199
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,499
We don't have the leeway
to let even Genin sit idle.

200
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:22,671
However, fortunately or unfortunately,
Kurenai has been hospitalized,

201
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:26,342
so you guys, Team 8,
no longer have a mission.

202
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,598
Rather than just letting
you sit around and play,

203
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,848
I'd rather place my bet
on that 10% possibility.

204
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,184
Huh... you mean...

205
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:40,522
Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka.
Hinata Hyuga.

206
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:43,359
I order you to search for
the bikochu!

207
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:44,781
- All right!
- All right!

208
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:47,086
I designate Shino
as the leader this time.

209
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,288
And... that spy up there!

210
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,414
Oww...!

211
00:15:58,741 --> 00:15:59,721
Naruto...

212
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,014
You're going to go even if
I try to stop you, right?

213
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:02,805
Yup!

214
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,849
In that case, I have no choice
but to let you go...

215
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:07,512
However...

216
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:10,219
This is your last chance.

217
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:12,815
If you don't find the bikochu...

218
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,189
you must give up on Sasuke!

219
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:16,268
Wha?

220
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,312
You understand?!

221
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,882
It'll be fine...
I'll find it without fail.

222
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:23,774
All right. You won't go back
on your word, right?

223
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:27,444
Yeah! Leave it to me!

224
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,071
You're easily pleased, aren't you?

225
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,885
Owww!

226
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:33,116
<i>Naruto...</i>

227
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,503
Sasuke...

228
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,611
Hinata.

229
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:53,971
Good morning.

230
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,099
Neji will be here soon
for his training...

231
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,143
Please prepare tea as always.

232
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,586
W-Well...

233
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:02,021
Huh? What's the matter?

234
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,690
I need to go...
on a mission starting now...

235
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:06,108
A mission, huh...

236
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,925
In that case, it can't be helped...

237
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm heading out...

238
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:14,207
Don't be a burden to the others.

239
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:17,531
Yes, sir!

240
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:32,905
I'm... I'm sorry! I'm in a hurry...

241
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,595
That was an elegant pivot.

242
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:39,811
<i>Hinata...</i>

243
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,687
You're late, Hinata!

244
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,229
I'm sorry!

245
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:50,259
All right then! Let's head out!

246
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,108
Let's go!

247
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:55,092
Huh?

248
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,490
Why are you walking at
such a leisurely pace?!

249
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,700
It takes a shinobi two days on foot

250
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,664
to get to the habitat of
the bikochu...

251
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:05,203
There's no need to make haste
from the very start.

252
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:13,092
But what if the eggs hatch
before we get there?

253
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:17,221
The eggs of bikochu only hatch
on the day after it's rained...

254
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,598
There's no sign of it
raining any time soon...

255
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,469
But... if by some remote chance...

256
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:21,993
Naruto.

257
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,451
Wh-What is it?

258
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:25,687
I am the leader of this team.

259
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:29,116
While we are on this mission,
you will obey the orders of your leader.

260
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:39,618
Kiba, I can't believe you're able
to work with that kind of guy...

261
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,595
Well, I've gotten used to it...

262
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,249
I'm sure you'll bond with him too, Naruto.

263
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,587
I wonder about that...

264
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,804
Naruto and the others
left a while ago.

265
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,549
I see.

266
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,058
Didn't you want to go too?

267
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,665
<i>When it comes to searching
for insects,</i>

268
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,442
<i>Shino, who's an insect handler,
is number one...</i>

269
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,706
<i>And then Hinata who has Byakugan...</i>

270
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,238
<i>and Kiba and Akamaru who have
sensitive noses are there too...</i>

271
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:15,989
<i>So there's really no part
for me to play!</i>

272
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,103
<i>What I must do right now...</i>

273
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>is to become a Medical Ninja
as soon as I possibly can!</i>

274
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,102
What's the matter, Shino?!

275
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,040
The sun's going down.
We're setting up camp.

276
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:35,883
Got it.

277
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:36,596
- Huh?
- Okay.

278
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,653
Huh? What?!

279
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:40,702
We're gonna set up
camp already?!

280
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:45,163
I'm not tired at all yet!
Let's go further!

281
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,756
Naruto, the leader of
this team is me.

282
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,124
I-I understand!

283
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,585
Okay then... let's sleep.

284
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,466
Huh... we're gonna sleep already?!

285
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:03,035
Many animals and plants
go to sleep at sunset

286
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,664
and are awake at sunrise.

287
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,698
In order to search for insects,

288
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,271
we must sync our bodies
to the rhythm of nature.

289
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,911
But... the sun's just set...

290
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,188
Naruto, I am the leader of this team...

291
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,969
Okay, okay. I got it!

292
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:24,174
There's no way
I can sleep so early...

293
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,447
Yeah, right...

294
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:31,804
All that complaining and guess
who's the first one to fall asleep?

295
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,411
I have to pee...

296
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:16,473
Huh?

297
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:17,543
Huh?

298
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:19,208
What's that?

299
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:30,414
It's a waterfall...

300
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:34,326
Hey... Is somebody there?

301
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,442
S-Say...

302
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,182
Damn it...!

303
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,810
S-Sorry.
Did I scare you?

304
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:07,969
Huh?

305
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:12,820
There's nobody there...

306
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,978
Huh, Naruto...
Did you catch a cold?

307
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:24,409
Yeah... a little...

308
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:30,065
After sleeping so much
you're still tired?

309
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:31,758
Well, uh...

310
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:35,007
When I woke up last night to pee,
I saw something awesome...

311
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,509
Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?

312
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:39,535
No, I'm okay...

313
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,911
And... what was that awesome thing?

314
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:45,281
It was a beautiful woman
in the middle of the waterfall!

315
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:45,808
Huh?

316
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:50,400
When that person moved her arms,
the water would suddenly move too!

317
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,965
It was awesome!

318
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:53,417
And what happened then...

319
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,814
When I tried to speak to her,
she suddenly vanished.

320
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,945
You must have been dreaming
or something.

321
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,126
It's starting to feel that way...

322
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,591
You idiot!

323
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,370
Your face is red, Hinata.

324
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:11,241
You might have really
caught a cold.

325
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,598
Huh... really, I'm fine...

326
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:20,649
This fruit is edible.
This will be our meal today.

327
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:22,458
Got it.

328
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,530
We can save on
our food supplies too.

329
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,561
There's one thing
I need to warn you about.

330
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,388
On rare occasions, this fruit grows
to the size of a human being.

331
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,314
However, those fruits
are damaged inside.

332
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,352
Don't tamper with them
under any circumstance.

333
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:39,603
There's nobody who would
eat something that huge.

334
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,301
N-Naruto...!

335
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,066
He's eating it...

336
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,784
Naruto... We're going on ahead...

337
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:58,410
I'll... I'll be right behind you!

338
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,146
Sorry to keep you waiting!

339
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:07,927
Wait just a second!

340
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,430
Hey... aren't we there yet?

341
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,195
Yes.

342
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:39,101
We're here!

343
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,108
What...?

344
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,070
Wow!

345
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,983
I've never seen anything
like this before.

346
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:55,410
This certainly isn't a place
where humans could inhabit.

347
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:58,990
That's right...
That's why it's paradise for insects.

348
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:02,083
D-Don't tell me...

349
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,170
Could it be that... over there...?

350
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,771
You mean that's where
the bikochu are?

351
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,081
No problem.
It's better than the Chunin Exam.

352
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:19,351
Damn... The foothold crumbles easily...

353
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:20,810
- Naruto...
- What?

354
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,189
As the leader, I'm warning you...

355
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:26,471
At a time like this,
what is it?!

356
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:27,872
Don't fall.

357
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:31,685
I already know that
without your telling me!

358
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:33,500
Naruto!

359
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,716
No way...!

360
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:44,431
That was close...

361
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,050
Those were insects, huh...

362
00:25:48,793 --> 00:25:50,131
That's why I warned you.

363
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:53,530
When this mission is over,

364
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:55,810
I'm definitely gonna kick
that guy's butt!

365
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,396
This is... the bikochu forest.

366
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Let's go.

367
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:24,076
There's no mistake.
Those are Leaf shinobi.

368
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,668
The fact that those guys came to
a place like this

369
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:28,474
means their objective is...

370
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:33,592
Yeah... it's the same as ours...
the bikochu.

371
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,927
We're not gonna let them
take any bikochu.

372
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:41,112
The bikochu belong to us,
the Kamizuru clan!

373
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,025
It's so quiet, isn't it?

374
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:48,581
Peace is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

375
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:53,247
Being able to...
drink sake tranquilly like this...

376
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:01,413
Please, this isn't the time
to be drinking sake!

377
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,398
Especially at a time when
the village is enjoying peace...

378
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:09,044
you should hurry up and
finish up your work!

379
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:13,765
Why is it that work
never seems to cease?

380
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:17,811
That's because you never complete
a single thing, Lady Tsunade!

381
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,523
There's disquiet among
the Kamizuru Clan?

382
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:23,721
That's a communiquÃ© from
the ANBU unit

383
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:25,346
stationed in the Land of the Earth,
isn't it?

384
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,585
I don't think I'm
familiar with the name...

385
00:27:28,323 --> 00:27:32,700
The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers
of the Hidden Stone Village.

386
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,076
Long ago, they were so famous
as to be extolled

387
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:37,511
as equals of the Aburame Clan...

388
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:45,921
But they've faded into obscurity
and their name is barely remembered.

389
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,506
I see...

390
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:52,557
It says there's been some disquiet,
but there can't be many of them left.

391
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,173
It's really nothing to worry about...

392
00:27:59,562 --> 00:28:02,604
Wow... There are so many insects...

393
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,310
This is truly a paradise for insects...

394
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,497
We won't get stung, will we?

395
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,962
Almost none of these insects will
cause bodily harm to humans.

396
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:14,461
I do have some of the Aburame Clan's
secret recipe insect repellant...

397
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:17,812
but I would prefer not to use it,
if at all possible.

398
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,821
Because it would also repel
the bikochu.

399
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,504
Then you shouldn't have
brought it out in the first place.

400
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,372
There's no mistake...

401
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,301
That kid in the lead...

402
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,806
he's a member of the Aburame Clan,
after all.

403
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:42,410
I never imagined that
we'd bump into them in a place like this.

404
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:46,861
Is their objective the bikochu, Jibachi?

405
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,404
Anyone who wants to get their hands
on a bikochu

406
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,206
has to come to this place
during this particular period.

407
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:58,288
The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan
rests on the outcome of this mission...

408
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:02,265
We need to get our hands on
a bikochu, no matter what!

409
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,212
This is a female bikochu.

410
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,043
Memorize its characteristics.

411
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,204
Okay!

412
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:14,484
Got it.

413
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,956
Hey, I've seen this thing before...

414
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:20,050
Hey, really?!

415
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:21,706
Where did you see it, Naruto?

416
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:23,903
That was...

417
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:30,606
When I inadvertently leave some food out,
they start coming out of nowhere.

418
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,106
A whole deluge of them...

419
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,293
So those were bikochu...

420
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,602
If it's those things,
they should be easy to catch.

421
00:29:42,184 --> 00:29:42,979
Hey...

422
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,692
Naruto...

423
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,010
Those are called... cockroaches.

424
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:48,907
Huh? Cockroaches?

425
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:52,000
You're completely mistaken.

426
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,711
This thing is completely different!

427
00:29:56,856 --> 00:29:58,730
They look exactly identical to me...

428
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,103
- They're not!
- They're not!

429
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,529
Depending on how you look at it,
this could be an opportunity.

430
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,857
What do you mean, Suzumebachi?

431
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:13,109
It's been ten days since we came here...

432
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:16,514
we haven't been able to get
any leads on the bikochu.

433
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,413
However, that kid from
the Aburame Clan might...

434
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:20,985
That makes sense!

435
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:24,264
You mean they might be able
to catch a bikochu...

436
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:27,650
From their appearance,
it seems they're all Genin.

437
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:30,416
If they're able to catch
a bikochu...

438
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:33,607
we'll just take it from them.

439
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:41,681
All insects look alike.

440
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:46,708
<i>Insect Summoning Jutsu!</i>

441
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,001
<i>There aren't any... here...</i>

442
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,093
This thing here
is different too, huh...

443
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:30,199
Huh?

444
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:43,499
<i>This mission
is something that I suggested...</i>

445
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,029
<i>so I will find it without fail!</i>

446
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:47,393
<i>Byakugan!</i>

447
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,342
<i>Just as I thought...</i>

448
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,093
<i>it's difficult to perceive things
as small as insects.</i>

449
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:07,413
<i>Huh?!</i>

450
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:16,744
Shino! Kiba!

451
00:32:17,088 --> 00:32:19,004
Hinata... Did you notice too?

452
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:21,277
So... you did too?

453
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,706
I guess... they think they're hiding...

454
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:26,962
Unfortunately for them,

455
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:30,689
we have a whole array of specialists
in detecting enemies.

456
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,787
What should we do, Shino?
You're the leader of this mission.

457
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,495
If we end up in a battle,
we risk harming the other insects...

458
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,471
and injuring the bikochu.

459
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,433
As long as they don't make a move,
we'll just watch them closely.

460
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:46,408
Got it.

461
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:49,522
I wonder if... Naruto noticed.

462
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,553
If he had noticed, he would've made
a huge racket by now.

463
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,683
I don't want to stir things up.
So don't tell him.

464
00:32:56,914 --> 00:32:57,414
Okay...

465
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:59,360
Hey, Shino! Shino!

466
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:01,329
I found it! I found it!

467
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,475
I'm telling you,
I found a bikochu!

468
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,398
He found it already?!

469
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:13,166
That's impossible!

470
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:16,265
When we spent ten days searching
and couldn't find one!

471
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,812
Awesome, Naruto...

472
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,605
Are you sure, Naruto?

473
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:22,940
Let me see it.

474
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:26,452
See... this is it, right?

475
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,991
It's exactly like the photo, right?

476
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,979
I might be an insect hunting genius.

477
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,077
Huh?

478
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,151
Does it look the same to you?

479
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,128
Huh?

480
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:46,128
That's called a goliath beetle...

481
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,104
Huh?! It's not the same thing

482
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:08,492
<i>Unless I control my chakra
more precisely,</i>

483
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:11,062
<i>I won't be able to find something
as small as an insect!</i>

484
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,303
<i>To come all this way and
continue training...</i>

485
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:18,931
<i>That's quite admirable...</i>

486
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,599
The air pressure has changed.

487
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,172
That's a sure sign that
the weather will change.

488
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,456
Yeah, I realize that.

489
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:08,090
A wind charged with moisture
has started blowing...

490
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,093
This means
there's gonna be rainfall.

491
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:14,438
When it's such good weather?

492
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,993
But I can see clouds
off in the distance...

493
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:17,995
Hinata...

494
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:22,339
We need to hurry.

495
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:27,906
Because it's said that the bikochu
only lays its eggs when it rains.

496
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,908
And larva emerges from the egg
the following morning.

497
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:34,536
In other words,

498
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:37,644
if it rains today, it'll become
a mature larva tomorrow morning.

499
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:40,890
In view of the season,
this may well be our last chance.

500
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:42,806
If this chance slips by,

501
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:46,060
it will become impossible to search
for Sasuke using a bikochu...

502
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:47,435
Sasuke...

503
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:55,955
It'll be fine.
I'll find it without fail!

504
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,499
Don't rain... Don't rain yet!

505
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:22,116
Damn! Where is it?!

506
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,342
Please come on out
before it rains!

507
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,404
Naruto...

508
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,962
What are we gonna do...

509
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:34,002
if those guys don't find
a bikochu, Suzumebachi?

510
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,003
It was the Aburame Clan

511
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,407
who was the catalyst in
the downfall of the Kamizuru Clan...

512
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:43,404
<i>In order to avenge our clan's
longstanding grudge...</i>

513
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:45,092
<i>we will finish them off!</i>

514
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:54,900
Those guys...
They haven't made a move yet.

515
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:59,175
They must know that we're searching
for the bikochu.

516
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:03,303
Which means that they must be waiting
for us to find one.

517
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:08,454
I get it... So their plan is to snatch it
from us after we find it.

518
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,755
What lazy jerks...

519
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:20,511
Rain...

520
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,264
Not this one either!

521
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:31,395
Damn! When I told it not to rain!

522
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:38,114
<i>There's no more time...</i>

523
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,897
<i>Don't be a burden to everyone...</i>

524
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,516
<i>So ultimately...
I contributed nothing.</i>

525
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:52,291
There's still plenty of time!

526
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,114
Naruto...

527
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:05,413
<i>I will not go back on my word...
That's my Ninja Way!</i>

528
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,624
<i>Naruto, I won't give up either!</i>

529
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:15,374
<i>Byakugan!</i>

530
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:24,458
<i>I have to...
I have to concentrate more...</i>

531
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:34,096
<i>I need to... I need to...
control my chakra!</i>

532
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:37,963
<i>I can see them!
So those are insects!</i>

533
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,370
<i>That insect... is wrong...</i>

534
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,183
<i>This insect is wrong too.</i>

535
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:48,667
<i>That's...!</i>

536
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:52,996
<i>There it is!</i>

537
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:58,942
Naruto! On the side of that tree!
There's a bikochu there!

538
00:39:23,468 --> 00:39:24,924
I caught it!

539
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:25,845
<i>We did it...!</i>

540
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,815
I did it! I caught it!

541
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,707
There's no mistake.
It's a female bikochu.

542
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:38,628
- Yes! I did it!
- Cripes...

543
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,353
Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!

544
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,799
That's so great, Naruto!

545
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:44,249
Hinata! It's thanks to you!

546
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:48,364
<i>Naruto... is... hugging me!</i>

547
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,112
What's the matter, Akamaru?

548
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,811
All right! It's an egg!

549
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,300
It laid an egg, huh...

550
00:39:59,106 --> 00:39:59,710
Really?

551
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,691
It will emerge by tomorrow...

552
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,589
So then we should make it
recognize Sasuke's scent, right?!

553
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,503
It looks like they finally found one...

554
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,457
The time has come, hasn't it?

555
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:17,774
Yeah...

556
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:28,349
That Naruto... He suddenly...

557
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,799
pressed his face so close to mine...

558
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:38,312
So... you were able
to dodge that one just now.

559
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,023
That was pretty well done
for a Genin.

560
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:46,926
<i>They're the ones who've
been trailing us all this time...</i>

561
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,781
However, I wonder if you'll be able
to escape from this attack?

562
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,902
<i>Ninja Art: Honey Jutsu!</i>

563
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:55,964
Bees?!

564
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:09,631
No... that's!

565
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:15,874
It looks like you've noticed, huh.
That's honey.

566
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:18,854
It's a honey that works like
a bonding agent!

567
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,338
I used up all my chakra earlier...

568
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,818
That thing is a real bee.

569
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:38,890
<i>Naruto...</i>

570
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,123
What do you think, Akamaru?

571
00:41:52,854 --> 00:41:53,513
I see...

572
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,348
I figured those guys would make
some kind of move.

573
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,614
There hasn't been any sign
of them since earlier...

574
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,748
There's a possibility that
we've overlooked something.

575
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,773
Hey, Naruto!

576
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,706
Huh?

577
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:07,813
Where's Hinata?

578
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:09,605
She said she was gonna
go wash her face.

579
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:10,707
Hmm...

580
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:15,449
But she's been gone for a while.
I wonder what she's doing.

581
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:16,605
Could it be that...?!

582
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,943
Huh? What?

583
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:19,870
- Naruto!
- Wha?!

584
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:25,302
A letter on a kunai?

585
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:26,578
Huh?!

586
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,749
<i>"We have the kunoichi hostage."</i>

587
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,496
<i>"If you want to get her back,"</i>

588
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,391
<i>"it'll be in exchange for
the bikochu."</i>

589
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,969
<i>"Come to the top of
the eastern hill later tonight."</i>

590
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,450
Damn! So that was their move!

591
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,354
Hinata...!

592
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,329
What the heck is happening...?

593
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:55,919
Why does Hinata have
to be kidnapped?!

594
00:42:56,461 --> 00:43:00,421
And how do these guys know
we're looking for the bikochu?!

595
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:04,653
We were being watched all this time.
Ever since we arrived...

596
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,792
You were aware of that?!

597
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,937
You're the only one who didn't know.

598
00:43:09,226 --> 00:43:11,642
Why didn't you tell me?!

599
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,981
Because if we told you,
you would've just made a scene!

600
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:17,507
And you'd scare away all the insects!

601
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,117
Including the bikochu!

602
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,817
If they tried to steal the bikochu
from us with force,

603
00:43:27,435 --> 00:43:29,211
the insects would be in danger
of getting hurt.

604
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:33,502
So they captured Hinata to force
a hostage exchange.

605
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,024
That's very smart of them.

606
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,953
Something smells sweet...

607
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,659
It's the smell of honey.

608
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,091
Bee's honey...

609
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:43,098
Bees...?

610
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,111
Hinata's scent ends here...

611
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:49,783
In that case...

612
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:01,196
Those guys waited for a moment when
Hinata was alone

613
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,434
and attacked her using bees.

614
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:06,501
I heard that in the Hidden Stone Village
in the Land of Earth,

615
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,305
there's a clan of insect handlers
who primarily use bees.

616
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,990
The name of that clan is...
the Kamizuru Clan.

617
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:17,110
Kamizuru? You don't hear
that name much anymore.

618
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:21,988
Seems they were once hailed as being
at a level equal to the Aburame Clan...

619
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:23,894
But they aren't anymore?

620
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,412
This is a story from
my grandfather's time...

621
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:31,720
There was a time when the shinobi
of the Hidden Stone Village

622
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:33,811
were going to invade the Leaf Village...

623
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:37,977
The Kamizuru Clan was designated
to spearhead the operation...

624
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:41,512
The plan was to create
a disruption by releasing

625
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:44,621
a large swarm of bees into the village,
followed by the main invasion force...

626
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:48,774
However, the Aburame clan
anticipated their plan

627
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,504
and prepared to engage the enemy
in the forest to the west!

628
00:44:59,902 --> 00:45:03,211
This battle between insect handlers
which had no precedent in history...

629
00:45:03,236 --> 00:45:05,223
ended in the Aburame's victory...

630
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,690
With this battle as the turning point,

631
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:15,774
the Aburame Clan rose to
unchallenged status

632
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,396
in the Hidden Leaf Village...

633
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:20,892
On the other hand,
the Kamizuru clan was shunned

634
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,302
even in their own village.

635
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,101
I've heard that only a few of them
remain now...

636
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:31,498
So those people came here
to capture bikochu, huh?

637
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:35,515
What the heck are those guys
planning to do with the bikochu?

638
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:41,368
If my insects come back
we might be able to learn something...

639
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,681
<i>I see... I've been captured...</i>

640
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:25,387
The Hidden Leaf Village is
in a difficult situation right now...

641
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:28,145
Because of that incident
at the recent Chunin Exam?

642
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:32,771
The Hokage was assassinated,
and I hear they lost many shinobi too.

643
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:38,372
Times are about to change dramatically...

644
00:46:39,235 --> 00:46:41,753
This is a chance for us,
the Kamizuru Clan,

645
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,198
to distinguish ourselves.

646
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,887
But to do that...

647
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,506
The founder's Book of Secrets, huh?

648
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:51,176
A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu
for Insect Handlers

649
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:53,807
are supposedly written in it,
among other things...

650
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:57,455
If we possessed that at the time of
the battle with the Aburame Clan,

651
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,306
we wouldn't have lost...

652
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:03,269
However, Clan members have continued
to search for it for many years,

653
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:04,542
but couldn't find it.

654
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:08,208
Do you really think
we can find it after all this time?

655
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:10,411
That's why we need the bikochu...

656
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:16,992
I brought the keepsakes
of the founder, my grandfather, with me...

657
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:21,941
When the bikochu emerges,
it will pursue the scent it recognizes.

658
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,839
And we should be able
to locate the Book of Secrets

659
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:27,513
that my grandfather hid
before he died.

660
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,407
This strand of his hair
will surely lead us to it.

661
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,199
If we get our hands on
the Book of Secrets

662
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:36,190
and if we make a big move...

663
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:40,305
I am certain that... the people of
the village will also acknowledge us.

664
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:46,107
<i>Those people are also desperately
seeking recognition.</i>

665
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,194
<i>Naruto...</i>

666
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:08,865
Did you find out anything?
How about Hinata's whereabouts?

667
00:48:09,534 --> 00:48:13,697
No... My other insects were likely
eliminated by them.

668
00:48:13,986 --> 00:48:18,033
Damn! Then our only choice
is to do what they want?

669
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,180
When I went to all that
trouble of finding it...

670
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:23,901
So you want to desert Hinata?

671
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:26,826
H-How could anyone possibly do that?!

672
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,687
I won't desert her no matter
what might happen!

673
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:32,399
Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!

674
00:48:33,423 --> 00:48:34,094
Exactly.

675
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:39,704
But then we'd be able to locate Sasuke
if we have this guy here...

676
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:43,957
Well, I guess we'll just have to find
another way to track down Sasuke.

677
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,671
Yeah... Right now, the first thing
we need to do is rescue Hinata.

678
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:51,939
But, do you think Hinata
would be satisfied with that?

679
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,111
This entire mission was
originally Hinata's idea.

680
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:57,601
Huh? But...

681
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:01,503
It's true that I told her about
the existence of bikochu...

682
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,462
However...

683
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,101
The odds of finding
a bikochu are extremely low...

684
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:12,662
We thought that she should aspire
to an important mission

685
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:17,450
with an assured outcome for the village,
rather than a mission with such low odds.

686
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:22,456
But Hinata didn't give up.

687
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,966
She argued persistently that
if there was even a small possibility,

688
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,716
we had to take the chance.

689
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:33,700
Th-That Hinata did...?

690
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:40,405
She was so insistent that
Shino and I had to agree.

691
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:45,100
It's the first time Hinata
ever volunteered for a mission.

692
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,021
For that reason too,
I want to make this a success.

693
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:50,173
Yeah.

694
00:49:50,663 --> 00:49:54,614
But when we don't know
where Hinata is, how are we...?

695
00:49:55,615 --> 00:49:58,490
There is one place where Hinata
will definitely make an appearance.

696
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,509
I see! The place where...

697
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,069
... the exchange with
the bikochu takes place!

698
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:08,414
We will definitely have
a chance at that time.

699
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:12,304
All right!
We will recover Hinata without fail...

700
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:14,995
and we will also protect
the bikochu to the very end!

701
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,479
We brought the bikochu!
Return Hinata!

702
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:32,181
Place the insect cage
on that rock over there!

703
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:33,583
Hinata!

704
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:36,838
Release Hinata!

705
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:38,903
I must verify it first!

706
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:52,916
What's... the meaning of this?!

707
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:58,154
Are you trying to make a mockery
of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!

708
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,900
A goliath beetle...
You gotta be kidding!

709
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:04,966
Now, Shino!

710
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:06,074
What?!

711
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:07,441
<i>Parasitic Insects!</i>

712
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:11,485
Heh! Got her back!

713
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:14,893
Naruto!

714
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,119
All right, it's over! Give up!

715
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:24,139
Your time's up!

716
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:29,219
What's this?

717
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:35,649
This one doesn't smell like Hinata!

718
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,006
Huh?!

719
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:40,175
Just as I thought...

720
00:51:42,824 --> 00:51:43,898
Beeswax?

721
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,680
There they come!

722
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,346
Damn! You jerk! You jerk!

723
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,640
Damn! All these things are honey?!

724
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:59,148
Sorry, Naruto...
But these damn bees!

725
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:00,451
There's no end to them!

726
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,011
Do we need to slash them
if they're honey?!

727
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,176
You two don't move from there!

728
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:08,221
Huh?

729
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:12,516
This one's real! And what's more,
it's filled with deadly poison.

730
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,492
It appears that genuine ones
are mixed in...

731
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:18,084
But they're indistinguishable
from each other!

732
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,099
Back me up for a little!

733
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,854
<i>Wall of Insects Jutsu!</i>

734
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,281
A-Awesome...

735
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:42,115
Amazing power for a Genin...

736
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,769
Just what I'd expect
from the Aburame clan.

737
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,782
The Kamizuru Clan...

738
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:54,913
Huh...? So you knew who we were.

739
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:56,884
Return Hinata!

740
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:59,596
Of course, our intention was
to return her...

741
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:03,103
But only if you calmly hand over
the bikochu.

742
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:05,215
However...

743
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,698
It looks like you have
no intention of doing that!

744
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,104
In that case,
what do you plan on doing?

745
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,801
If you're an insect handler,

746
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:14,281
you wouldn't bring a delicate insect
like the bikochu

747
00:53:14,306 --> 00:53:16,381
to a dangerous place
like a battleground...

748
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,297
We'll finish you off right here...

749
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:22,105
and then take our time searching
for the bikochu!

750
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:26,002
<i>Wall of Insects Jutsu!</i>

751
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,054
Is that all he's got?!

752
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,301
Shino! Paper bombs!

753
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:47,701
Take this!

754
00:53:49,428 --> 00:53:50,909
<i>1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!</i>

755
00:54:00,502 --> 00:54:01,473
<i>Insect Clones...?</i>

756
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,265
<i>Up to your annoying tricks, huh...</i>

757
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:11,890
Shino! What are we gonna do now?!

758
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,171
Don't you think we should
go back there for a moment?

759
00:54:14,688 --> 00:54:17,396
Those guys
might find the bikochu!

760
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,899
No... that location
will definitely be safe.

761
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:24,660
More importantly, the first thing
we need to do is search for Hinata!

762
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:34,613
There's no mistake.

763
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:37,315
Inside here.

764
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:40,026
Hinata! Where are you?!

765
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,195
Hey! Be careful!

766
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:44,967
There's no sign of those guys,
but it might be a trap...

767
00:54:46,978 --> 00:54:47,697
Is she there?!

768
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:49,378
Hinata?

769
00:54:57,788 --> 00:54:58,530
Hinata!

770
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,120
Are you all right, Hinata?

771
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,205
I'll rescue you in a moment!

772
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:18,830
Just a little more!

773
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,611
All right... I got it off!

774
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:26,716
Naruto...

775
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:29,783
Thank you!

776
00:55:29,973 --> 00:55:31,222
H-Hinata?!

777
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,329
H-Hinata... stop that!

778
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:42,197
What do you think you're doing,
out of the blue like that?!

779
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:44,603
Who... are you?

780
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:48,803
What are you talking about, Shino?
That's Hinata.

781
00:55:49,576 --> 00:55:51,325
If you're really Hinata,

782
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:55,541
you'd get red in the face
and faint if you hugged Naruto.

783
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:56,420
- Huh?
- Oh!

784
00:55:56,943 --> 00:56:00,317
I see...
But Akamaru's nose wouldn't fail...

785
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:04,765
What? The smell of two people
is mingled?

786
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,978
You're not Hinata?

787
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:11,915
Naruto... It's me...
I'm Hinata, believe me.

788
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:13,303
In that case...

789
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:16,321
show us what you tried to stick
on Naruto's back right now!

790
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,708
A paper bomb?

791
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:25,173
So you were intending
to blow up Naruto!

792
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,818
I thought that would work...

793
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:35,974
You are...

794
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,558
I see, the one on the hill
was a clone, huh...

795
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,103
Wearing Hinata's clothes...

796
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,538
That's how she was able
to mask the scent.

797
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:46,885
Where is the real Hinata?!

798
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,611
I wonder where she could be?

799
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:58,335
I see...

800
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:02,608
Suzumebachi lured
the Aburame Clan, huh?

801
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:05,311
Well, it appears that your comrades...

802
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,805
place more value on the bikochu
than on you.

803
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:11,928
There's nobody else coming
to rescue you.

804
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:19,107
Jibachi, Let's search for
the bikochu that those guys hid!

805
00:57:21,399 --> 00:57:22,857
There's not much time until sunrise!

806
00:57:23,498 --> 00:57:23,999
Right!

807
00:57:24,436 --> 00:57:26,184
Don't even try to escape.

808
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:30,000
If you make even the smallest movement
out of the ordinary,

809
00:57:30,025 --> 00:57:31,649
those bees will cut the string.

810
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:36,935
Up ahead is the entrance to
an underground water vein...

811
00:57:39,549 --> 00:57:41,901
If you fall,
you'll be gone in an instant.

812
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,879
We don't wish to kill
anyone unnecessarily.

813
00:57:46,815 --> 00:57:49,907
If you want to live,
I suggest you just stay quiet.

814
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:56,801
<i>How mortifying... I ended up being
a burden to everyone, after all.</i>

815
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:04,204
You're all like moths to a flame!

816
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,535
If you're lucky, we'll meet again...

817
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:20,284
That place isn't just an ordinary cave.

818
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:29,322
Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!

819
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,192
There's nothing else to grab onto.

820
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:34,065
Be patient until I've checked
the surroundings!

821
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,301
No!

822
00:58:43,383 --> 00:58:45,582
A huge number of bee larvae!

823
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:46,906
Bee larvae, huh?

824
00:58:47,697 --> 00:58:50,155
But what's with their unusual huge size?

825
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:56,239
If you tell me where you hid the bikochu,
I'll spare your life.

826
00:58:56,264 --> 00:58:56,998
I refuse!

827
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:02,121
Searching for the bikochu is
the mission that we were given!

828
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:04,903
Then die!

829
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,503
Paper bombs!

830
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:11,081
Damn! Let's go, Akamaru!

831
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:13,518
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

832
00:59:15,373 --> 00:59:16,329
<i>That sound is...</i>

833
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:22,538
<i>I see... They're still continuing to fight
without giving up.</i>

834
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:25,306
<i>This is not the time to be crying...</i>

835
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:29,441
<i>I can't give up. This whole thing
was my idea!</i>

836
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:30,849
<i>Byakugan!</i>

837
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,647
<i>There are 13 bees...
attached to the string.</i>

838
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,197
<i>If I can take them all down at once...
I'll be saved.</i>

839
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,508
<i>But, to take down bees that small...</i>

840
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:57,698
<i>Impossible! This guy...</i>

841
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:06,090
<i>So what?!
I never know when to give up!</i>

842
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,075
<i>Naruto...</i>

843
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:12,205
<i>Yes... I won't give up either!</i>

844
01:00:13,283 --> 01:00:16,610
<i>I need to concentrate and
control my chakra...</i>

845
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,080
<i>Fang Over Fang!</i>

846
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,511
How many of them are there?!

847
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:29,589
Kiba!

848
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:34,627
I-I can't muster any strength...
Somehow my body is...

849
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:37,111
<i>No way!</i>

850
01:00:37,636 --> 01:00:42,366
The larvae in this hive's favorite food
is chakra!

851
01:00:42,391 --> 01:00:43,016
What?!

852
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:45,429
As long as you're in there,

853
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:48,605
they'll suck your chakra
right through the wall...

854
01:00:51,622 --> 01:00:52,405
What's the matter?

855
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,196
So have you decided
to tell me the location?

856
01:01:11,703 --> 01:01:12,303
<i>Now!</i>

857
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:20,780
<i>Four...</i>

858
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:23,258
<i>Five, six... ten...</i>

859
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,910
<i>Eleven, twelve, thirteen...</i>

860
01:01:26,456 --> 01:01:27,193
<i>Damn!</i>

861
01:01:35,378 --> 01:01:36,460
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

862
01:01:45,642 --> 01:01:47,974
Do you want to be food for the larvae...

863
01:01:48,368 --> 01:01:51,403
or would you like to get out of here
and become the prey of this girl here?

864
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:53,903
Choose whichever you like!

865
01:01:59,202 --> 01:01:59,789
Kiba!

866
01:02:02,742 --> 01:02:03,348
Naruto!

867
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,599
This isn't good.

868
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:09,709
Oh my, what's wrong?

869
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:12,122
So you'll just stay there
and become larvae food?

870
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:13,146
Queen Bee...

871
01:02:20,546 --> 01:02:22,706
That kind of stuff shouldn't
be effective, should it?!

872
01:02:39,394 --> 01:02:39,990
<i>Chakra...!</i>

873
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:43,685
<i>Byakugan!</i>

874
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:58,032
<i>It's no good... There's no way
I can make it in time!</i>

875
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:00,657
<i>Naruto...</i>

876
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:04,968
<i>I don't know when to give up!</i>

877
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:08,305
<i>That's right...</i>

878
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:13,905
<i>I know that Naruto would never give up,
no matter what the situation is!</i>

879
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,569
Hey, did you catch them?

880
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:46,337
What a foolish group!

881
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:48,416
They made this creature mad...

882
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:50,952
And they all got bound in wax!

883
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:53,513
Bees make wax...

884
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:57,296
You're an insect handler
and you don't know that?

885
01:03:57,621 --> 01:04:00,792
He's right!
C'mon, are you really an insect handler?

886
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:02,999
What about the bikochu?

887
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:04,297
Nothing.

888
01:04:04,795 --> 01:04:07,211
We mobilized our insects to search,

889
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:08,410
but we haven't found it yet.

890
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,888
Aren't these guys carrying it?

891
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,182
That's unthinkable.

892
01:04:14,061 --> 01:04:15,111
So that means...

893
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:19,272
So we're going to have to
ask one of these guys, after all.

894
01:04:19,726 --> 01:04:21,349
Who's gonna talk?!

895
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:23,621
We can tell you.

896
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,012
Shino!

897
01:04:25,906 --> 01:04:28,739
However...
It's in exchange for Hinata.

898
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:32,460
That's stupid, isn't it? To bargain...

899
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,614
Do you not understand your position?

900
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:39,413
You guys definitely will not
find the bikochu.

901
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:43,898
And you're pressed for time.

902
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:48,342
You are the ones... who will regret this.

903
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:52,471
What should we do?

904
01:04:52,812 --> 01:04:54,109
If things stay like this,

905
01:04:54,134 --> 01:04:56,183
the bikochu won't be of any help
even if it hatches.

906
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:59,193
In that case, our mission is also...

907
01:05:01,571 --> 01:05:02,180
But...

908
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:05,426
If we can get rid of even one
of the Aburame family...

909
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:14,564
Hinata...

910
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:16,865
Are you worried?

911
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:18,754
Of course!

912
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,209
She's strong.

913
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,185
Huh?

914
01:05:25,887 --> 01:05:29,175
Much more... than you think.

915
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:37,106
I concede. We have a deal.

916
01:05:37,762 --> 01:05:39,606
First, we need our friend.

917
01:06:03,103 --> 01:06:03,771
What happened?

918
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:06,720
The brat... isn't here.

919
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:10,811
The wax she was trapped in isn't there...

920
01:06:12,044 --> 01:06:14,886
She may have been swept out
to the waterfall.

921
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:16,404
Jibachi!

922
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:21,613
Tough luck! I warned her that
one wrong move and she'd die.

923
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:22,999
You!

924
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:26,831
What did you do to Hinata?!

925
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,904
What happened to Hinata! Hey!

926
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:32,833
Shut up, kid.

927
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,066
That kid is long gone by now.

928
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,392
Damn you!

929
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:43,364
Aha, the girl's your girlfriend?

930
01:06:44,211 --> 01:06:49,088
You...! I absolutely will not forgive you!

931
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:54,527
You're kidding me.
What can you do in your condition?

932
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:59,118
Without Hinata you'll never get
your hands on the bikochu either.

933
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:01,878
You are right...

934
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:05,064
That girl's death was not part
of the plan,

935
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:08,274
but in the end, it's a good thing.

936
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:15,399
Because...
we'll take your lives in return.

937
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:19,451
From the very beginning,

938
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:22,455
the Hidden Leaf and Stone
have been sworn enemies.

939
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,892
It's natural that we kill
each other, isn't it?

940
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,610
What're ya gonna do, little guy?

941
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,708
Die like this?

942
01:07:35,373 --> 01:07:42,506
If you tell me where the bikochu is,
I could save you for now.

943
01:07:48,063 --> 01:07:51,025
- All right.
- Don't you dare tell them!

944
01:07:52,124 --> 01:07:56,506
Those jerks,
I'm going to blow them away!

945
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:01,077
Shut up, brat!

946
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,097
- Jibachi?
- Hey!

947
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:20,770
Shut up, I've got to kill him!

948
01:08:29,426 --> 01:08:30,206
It's a paper bomb!

949
01:08:43,348 --> 01:08:44,763
Y-You're...!

950
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:46,247
... still alive!

951
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:08,500
<i>That was really close.
But I didn't give up, just like Naruto...</i>

952
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:13,232
Did she escape from the wax?
It can't be!

953
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:15,734
These are not ordinary kids.

954
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,449
Leave it to me!

955
01:09:22,748 --> 01:09:23,352
Hinata!

956
01:09:25,289 --> 01:09:27,915
<i>I've never used that in an actual fight...</i>

957
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,423
<i>But I have to do it here, now!</i>

958
01:09:33,113 --> 01:09:34,403
<i>Bee Bombs Jutsu!</i>

959
01:09:35,682 --> 01:09:37,222
<i>1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!</i>

960
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:39,444
<i>Bee Swarm Jutsu!</i>

961
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:47,144
<i>Naruto...</i>

962
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:51,091
<i>Naruto... Watch me.</i>

963
01:09:59,921 --> 01:10:02,596
<i>Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!</i>

964
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:06,587
- What?!
- What?!

965
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,031
You're kidding, right?

966
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:20,551
Hinata can do
such an amazing jutsu?

967
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:24,052
The Hinata you know is from the past,
Naruto.

968
01:10:24,278 --> 01:10:25,661
What do you mean?

969
01:10:26,674 --> 01:10:30,862
You've learned new jutsu
since the Chunin Exams, haven't you?

970
01:10:31,787 --> 01:10:34,899
Hinata has been steadily improving, too.

971
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,065
She has always been concerned...

972
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:45,991
Take aim.

973
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,882
That's nice, the three of you,

974
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:55,303
all have something you're good at
and something you like.

975
01:10:56,094 --> 01:10:57,801
Hinata, you should find something, too...

976
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:00,297
You're right.

977
01:11:00,816 --> 01:11:02,356
By the way, what is it?

978
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:06,078
You had some business with me,
didn't you?

979
01:11:08,672 --> 01:11:09,274
Yeah...

980
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:14,294
I want you to join me
in my training.

981
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:20,520
Hinata was struggling with
what she could do...

982
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:22,187
What she should do...

983
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:32,098
Hinata!

984
01:11:32,977 --> 01:11:34,184
Hey, I don't think that we should...

985
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:36,542
No... Don't go easy on me!

986
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:41,507
If you're doing it for me...

987
01:11:43,108 --> 01:11:44,148
Do it seriously!

988
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:46,886
I've got it!

989
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,735
During the harsh training,

990
01:11:58,178 --> 01:12:02,699
Hinata discovered her own styles...
and her own special jutsu.

991
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:07,406
That's the result of her training.

992
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:16,185
Huh? You! How?!

993
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,197
I'll tell you something...

994
01:12:18,657 --> 01:12:22,209
Angering the Queen Bee,
getting encased in wax,

995
01:12:22,763 --> 01:12:24,340
it was all part of the strategy.

996
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:28,994
With our chakra being sucked
and being immobilized,

997
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:32,895
it was the only way to protect ourselves
from the larvae...

998
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:40,418
And, do you think I was doing nothing
while I was captured?

999
01:12:41,902 --> 01:12:46,612
I was giving orders to my insects.
This wax is actually very weak.

1000
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:55,427
Shino!

1001
01:12:57,015 --> 01:12:58,402
Because of her hard training,

1002
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:02,169
Hinata's chakra control
has dramatically improved.

1003
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,604
That jutsu is what she developed
from the training...

1004
01:13:07,385 --> 01:13:09,109
Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!

1005
01:13:11,864 --> 01:13:17,851
Hinata's already flexible body combined
with fine-tuned chakra control

1006
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,614
could completely defend
an attack from every direction...

1007
01:13:24,543 --> 01:13:26,485
Truly, it's an ultimate defense jutsu.

1008
01:13:28,483 --> 01:13:30,796
It's different from
Neji's 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.

1009
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:32,108
It's Hinata's own jutsu...

1010
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:36,698
She finally worked that out on her own.

1011
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:41,596
She probably did it because she wanted
to be acknowledged by her father.

1012
01:13:43,315 --> 01:13:45,001
To be acknowledged by everyone...

1013
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:52,197
And to be acknowledged by you.

1014
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:05,435
Our jutsu is completely useless?!

1015
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:07,165
What the hell is going on?

1016
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:09,099
What a girl!

1017
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,903
Hey, what happened to those guys?!

1018
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:13,041
When did they?!

1019
01:14:18,202 --> 01:14:19,492
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1020
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:28,001
Blow them away!

1021
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:43,076
Hinata!

1022
01:14:44,338 --> 01:14:44,904
Shino!

1023
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:50,210
Believe... in her.

1024
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,742
<i>Make the chakra...</i>

1025
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:01,788
<i>sharper, stronger...</i>

1026
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,625
<i>bigger, more flexible...</i>

1027
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:12,346
<i>more... more... more...
more... more... more... more!</i>

1028
01:15:27,509 --> 01:15:28,381
Hinata!

1029
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:30,740
Hinata!

1030
01:15:34,074 --> 01:15:35,517
Naruto...

1031
01:15:36,928 --> 01:15:42,490
Hinata, that's an awesome jutsu!
You're really awesome!

1032
01:15:44,857 --> 01:15:45,612
Naruto!

1033
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:52,015
Let's hurry. It'll be dawn soon.

1034
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,391
- Okay!
- Yeah!

1035
01:15:59,444 --> 01:16:02,140
It seems that they succeeded
at protecting the bikochu,

1036
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:06,199
but failed to have it memorize
the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.

1037
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:10,026
I see... Hinata must be depressed.

1038
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,652
This strategy was her idea, wasn't it?

1039
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:17,109
Well... Looks like that's not the case.

1040
01:16:20,173 --> 01:16:24,327
Hinata...
I heard that your mission failed.

1041
01:16:25,172 --> 01:16:27,216
Yes. It didn't work at all.

1042
01:16:28,595 --> 01:16:31,804
I just have to train even more...
and do better next time!

1043
01:16:32,641 --> 01:16:35,182
I-I see... Good luck.

1044
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:49,598
<i>More...</i>

1045
01:16:52,106 --> 01:16:52,803
<i>More...</i>

1046
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:54,786
<i>More...</i>

1047
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:57,945
<i>More!</i>
