1
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,235
Wh-Why...

2
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:46,561
Why does such
a good man have to... die?!

3
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:50,725
It's sad...
It's so sad!

4
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,873
I remember now...

5
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,794
I don't remember when,
but you showed it to me, didn't you?

6
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,501
With a twinkle in your eye,

7
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,843
you proudly told me
it was a memento from your father.

8
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:19,261
That pipe box, right?
It was an amazing piece of work.

9
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,860
No wonder you were so proud of it...

10
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:27,024
Even though I took it and smashed it,
you only laughed.

11
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:33,294
You were still smiling when
we kicked and threw you around.

12
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,514
It was a great smile.

13
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:37,587
Really...

14
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,387
Hold it in, Rokusuke!
They'll all be gone.

15
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,375
If we let this moment go,

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,647
there won't be another chance
to get out of the village!

17
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,050
But Kanpachi is!

18
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:50,745
It's for the village,

19
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,940
we have to do something and
make our way to that village!

20
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,108
Yeah...

21
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,392
Funerals are the best, aren't they!

22
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,019
I wanna do that again.

23
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:25,243
One... two... three of them...
got away again...

24
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,399
Looks like we can have
another funeral.

25
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:48,415
This is...

26
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,394
The Hidden Leaf Village.

27
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:52,701
You are...?

28
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,041
Naruto Uzumaki! I'm in the middle
of my training right now!

29
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:00,303
The Hidden Leaf Village...

30
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,757
H-Hey! I said hey!

31
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,089
Hang in there!

32
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,203
This is training too...!

33
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,909
I can't give up yet! Not yet!

34
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,439
The escort mission for the ruler of
the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,

35
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:52,805
was completed without incident!

36
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,054
Well done.

37
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,255
That's Lady Tsunade's...!

38
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:03,510
The best dumplings always come from
the Leaf Village, don't they?

39
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,700
That was my last one!

40
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,393
Mission Accomplished!

41
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,974
I've come to strike down
the pirates of the Gottani Channel

42
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,380
with the fist of love!

43
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,823
If they take this opportunity
to rehabilitate themselves,

44
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:27,198
it makes shedding these
tears of youth worthwhile!

45
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,608
I'll have your team do it for me.

46
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:39,391
Yes?

47
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:46,195
Just when we're busy enough,
Naruto goes and brings in more work.

48
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:50,064
After this, Guy has that S-rank mission.

49
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:54,829
The client picked him,
so he must depart today.

50
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:56,502
So, you'll do it without Guy.

51
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:58,845
That's pretty straightforward...

52
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,022
I called Neji, Tenten and Lee.

53
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:04,521
Ohh!

54
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:08,800
My pupils are more than capable of
completing this mission without any trouble!

55
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:09,998
Wait...

56
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,406
Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.

57
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:19,442
Why can't it just be my pupils,
who are adored by the heavens?

58
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,079
Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!

59
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,013
It just is.

60
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,095
Those three people that Naruto saved
came all the way

61
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,799
from the Katabami Gold Mine
to request a mission.

62
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:41,929
The Katabami Gold Mine is one of
the Land of Rivers' greatest mines,

63
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:45,396
but about half a year ago, a group
calling themselves the Kurosuki family

64
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:49,579
appeared on the pretext of guarding it,
and took control of the village...

65
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:53,504
killing villagers for
no particular reason.

66
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,010
How vile!

67
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,791
Your mission is this:

68
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,369
Once those three have
regained their strength,

69
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:04,114
escort them to the Katabami Gold Mine
and eliminate the Kurosuki family.

70
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,376
It's a simple mission.

71
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:10,214
Anyway, they're probably just
a bunch of punks after money.

72
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,800
Why did you call me for
such an easy mission?

73
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:18,909
Who do you think you are?

74
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:23,689
I'm busy training and searching
for Sasuke, andâ€”

75
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,340
You forced your way into missions
that you weren't called for.

76
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,605
It's not a genin's place
to pick and choose missions!

77
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,898
Would you like to be sent back
to the Academy? Well?!

78
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,555
Neji Hyuga.

79
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:35,301
Yes!

80
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,613
You're the leader!

81
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,618
It'll be good training for you
to handle someone so unruly.

82
00:07:41,188 --> 00:07:43,995
I'd rather not... but I accept.

83
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,309
I'll go continue my training!

84
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,056
Hey Naruto!

85
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,898
Please excuse them.
They have no manners...

86
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,931
Wait!

87
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,454
Those little brats...!

88
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,802
What do they think a mission is?!

89
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,862
Umm, excuse me?

90
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:15,914
What?!

91
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,755
The Kurosuki Family...

92
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,116
What did you say
their boss' name was?

93
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:20,999
Raiga!

94
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,603
That's what I thought...

95
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:23,888
What?

96
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:27,607
Well, on a previous mission,
I heard a rumor about him.

97
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:30,707
A rumor...?

98
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,010
Pervy Sage isn't back yet... and
now I'm being forced on a mission...

99
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,491
Oh, this is irritating...

100
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:40,617
Sakura!

101
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:41,794
Naruto?

102
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,600
What's going on? A bird?

103
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,444
Yesterday I found it injured
and treated it, but...

104
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:05,759
Sakura, that's amazing!

105
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,084
But poor thing.

106
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,244
It's separated from its friends.

107
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:19,709
Naruto!

108
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,214
Oh, sorry, did I intrude?

109
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,876
You intruded big time!

110
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,306
No, no!

111
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:31,202
You mustn't look back! In youth,
injuries are an absolute must!

112
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,504
Sakura, Hello!

113
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:36,236
Hello!

114
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,800
What did you come here for?

115
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:39,036
Just to have a word.

116
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,793
Huh? What the--?!

117
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,544
Oh, Sakura, goodbye!

118
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,974
- Hey! What was that?!
- She went wild, didn't she?

119
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:46,501
She should act her age...

120
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:51,637
What?! The boss of
the Kurosuki family

121
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,608
is one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist?

122
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:58,118
Yeah, it's exclusive information
from our respected Guy-sensei.

123
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,677
Who're the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist?

124
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:03,937
Naruto...

125
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,605
you fought in the Land of
the Waves mission, didn't you?

126
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:07,927
At that time...

127
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,302
Oh, Zabuza! And?

128
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:17,831
And Guy-sensei and Kakashi-sensei
fought Kisame Hoshigaki.

129
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,868
I heard that
you met them there too, Naruto.

130
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,807
Oh! I know that guy!

131
00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:27,677
Those two were once called

132
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:31,455
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

133
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,912
And at that time,
who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?

134
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:35,711
Oh!

135
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,398
 The man called Itachi! So?

136
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:42,803
You still don't understand?

137
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,305
If Raiga is one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist,

138
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,229
then he's probably tied to Itachi
who was with Kisame.

139
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,202
Oh! And?

140
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,800
Tell me, who's after Itachi?

141
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,202
I know! Sasuke!

142
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:00,574
That's right!

143
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,674
We can probably get a clue
about Sasuke's whereabouts

144
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:05,997
at the Katabami Gold Mine!

145
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,286
But...

146
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,845
If that's what Guy-sensei said then...

147
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:13,183
Don't say anything rude!

148
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,045
It's information that's
100% reliable!

149
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,173
Starting now,
while guarding Rokusuke and the others,

150
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,971
we head toward the Katabami Gold Mine

151
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,156
to fulfill our mission to
wipe out the Kurosuki family.

152
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,064
There's a shop I'm familiar
with close to the gold mine.

153
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,893
Let's make that the base.

154
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,811
What do you mean
a shop you're familiar with?

155
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:38,267
That's something to look forward to
on our journey.

156
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,300
That aside, Naruto is late...

157
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,173
If the source of the information
is Guy-sensei,

158
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,158
maybe he couldn't quite trust it?

159
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:50,303
That's not true!
Naruto will definitely come!

160
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,646
That's because Guy-sensei's
information is correct!

161
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:55,953
Whatever.

162
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,061
Here I am!

163
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:03,012
We're all here so...!

164
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:05,825
Is that for you to say?!

165
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,770
Let's go!

166
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:11,309
So... which way?

167
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,732
Don't be so anxious, Rokusuke,

168
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:43,704
Those kids will save our town.

169
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,908
It's post meal training!

170
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,008
I won't lose!

171
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,662
I won't lose!

172
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,606
How long do you intend
to rest here?!

173
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:12,693
If we hurry, maybe we can still save
Kanpachi from being buried...

174
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:14,499
Give it up...

175
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,501
How long do you think
it's been since that happened?

176
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:19,401
It's painful but...

177
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:31,796
I remember... this sleepiness.
The shop is close by.

178
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,950
You say you're sleepy,
so are you walking in your sleep?!

179
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,092
It's okay.

180
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:41,507
I slept while on a marathon on
this road for three days straight.

181
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,004
You're joking, right?

182
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:44,311
It's true.

183
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,087
A youthful marathon with Guy-sensei.

184
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,895
My body still remembers it.

185
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,102
I've gotten sleepy.

186
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:55,004
Hey, Bushy Brow,
are you really okay?

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,585
That's right. In this area,
there's the scent of spicy curry.

188
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,293
Curry? Now that you mention it...

189
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,064
That's right!

190
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,549
Over there!
It's the Curry of Life Shop!

191
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,871
Grandma Sansho!

192
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,128
Oh my...
Oh goodness!

193
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:19,511
I haven't seen you for a while!

194
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:22,364
- Oh my my my!
- You're looking well!

195
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,202
So this is the shop Lee was talking about?

196
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,555
That mountain is
the Katabami Gold Mine.

197
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,404
Grandma Sansho's curry saved my life.

198
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:44,500
So you're saying
it's delicious curry?

199
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:48,503
No, it really saved my life.
I'm indebted to this curry.

200
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,814
It was when
I'd just become a Genin...

201
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:56,204
When Guy-sensei gave me
a special training routine.

202
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,445
Oh my, that's right.
I remember.

203
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:05,586
Do your best!

204
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,048
Oh my...

205
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:11,438
Hey Grandma Sansho!

206
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,391
Oh my, they've come again!

207
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,480
Those people are running in their sleep.

208
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,782
Karashi! Karashi!

209
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:39,079
If you had that kind of energy,
you wouldn't lose to the bullies.

210
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:46,628
Oh my,
I might have said too much.

211
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:10,711
Oh my! It's the third day.

212
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,821
They've been running the whole time.

213
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:18,160
Oh my. What a problem.

214
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,221
I wonder if he's hungry...?

215
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,481
What a pickle! He's not waking up!

216
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,983
Maybe I didn't use
enough spice?

217
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,084
Karashi...

218
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:12,047
I've never seen a person
who works this hard.

219
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:17,386
Oh really... so you want to help
this young man too?

220
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,984
This is the Curry of Life.

221
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,298
Now! Grandma Sansho went to
the trouble of making this curry.

222
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,957
Let's eat!

223
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,377
I'm digging in!

224
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:19,690
Delicious! This is super delicious!

225
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,678
Delicious! The use of spices
is wonderful!

226
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,770
And this rice
goes perfectly with the curry!

227
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:42,903
Delicious!

228
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:47,246
By the way, I don't see Karashi.

229
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:50,721
Karashi saw how hard you worked

230
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,666
and became a bright kid
full of energy, but...

231
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:57,669
He got too much energy
and left for town.

232
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:58,473
What?

233
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:03,428
I was wrong to keep telling him
to be stronger.

234
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,384
"I'm going to be a man!

235
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,532
I'm going to be part of
the Kurosuki family, he said.

236
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:16,486
Oh my! I'm not blaming you.
Don't worry.

237
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,838
It's too late.

238
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,764
I'm responsible...

239
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,404
Oh my.

240
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,803
Neji!

241
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:26,176
Please add Karashi's rescue
to our mission objectives!

242
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,874
We'll bring him back from
the road of evil!

243
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:35,147
It's fine.

244
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,338
We'll use this shop as a base
and take a good look into the village.

245
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,610
Then we'll come up with a strategy
and spring into action.

246
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,341
Yes!

247
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,353
You guys await orders here.

248
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,490
Because it's dangerous
if the Kurosuki family finds us.

249
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,481
It's a disaster!

250
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:04,447
Rokusuke! Rokusuke!
He's gone!

251
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,731
I'm sure he went to town alone!

252
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:11,768
That's not good!

253
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,271
If those guys find Rokusuke...!

254
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:18,178
Now that it's come to this,

255
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:20,080
we don't have time
to come up with a strategy!

256
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,077
Let's get right to it!

257
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:23,838
No!

258
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,283
We'll get right to it!

259
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:30,204
Let's hurry.

260
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>Wait for me, Kanpachi,
I'm coming now...</i>

261
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,967
Someone... is coming...

262
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:50,057
Oh, another one...
Looks like it's time for a funeral!

263
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:06,234
Please don't die...
I'll get you out now.

264
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:13,913
Hey!

265
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,760
What are you doing there?

266
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:40,273
One, two...
One, two...

267
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,427
<i>Hope they're all right.</i>

268
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:50,942
<i>I'm sure they'll be able
to bring Karashi back.</i>

269
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,080
Definitely, Definitely.

270
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,726
One, two...

271
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:08,510
That's the Katabami Gold Mine...

272
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:11,850
Instead of just getting
Rokusuke and Karashi back,

273
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,003
let's finish the Kurosuki Family
once and for all!

274
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,644
Don't get carried away, Naruto.

275
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,230
So, what's the plan then?

276
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,692
I'm kind of worried about
what Guy-sensei told us.

277
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,927
The boss of the Kurosuki Family
may be

278
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:28,538
one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

279
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,491
Who knows what
they'll do to Rokusuke?

280
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:35,412
Yeah, but how reliable is
Guy-sensei's information?

281
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,042
What are you talking about?!
Guy-sensei is always right!

282
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,128
Calm down, Lee.
We should investigate first.

283
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:44,588
Yeah!

284
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,402
Sir Raiga, we were able
to capture Rokusuke,

285
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:09,773
one of the three that
slipped out of the village.

286
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:16,995
Well done.

287
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:26,517
It seems that they went to ask
for some help from a ninja village.

288
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,468
Where did you go?!

289
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,369
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,198
Stand down, rookie.

291
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:34,316
Yes sir!

292
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,919
Rokusuke, I thought we had
a good relationship

293
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:42,959
with everybody in the Gold Mine.

294
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:45,586
Well, that's...

295
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:53,073
Why would you do that? I'm so sad
to hear that you left the village.

296
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,607
I can't remember how things
were in the past,

297
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,133
when everything was going well.

298
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:00,997
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again!

299
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,765
Yeah, I have a good idea.

300
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,942
I'm going to arrange for your funeral.

301
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:12,204
Please don't! Please let me go!

302
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:15,706
I won't do it again,
so please forgive me!

303
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,683
Why? Don't you like funerals?

304
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:22,871
No, I don't wanna die yet!

305
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:26,478
You know, I really like funerals...

306
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,550
Think about it.

307
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,238
When they are alive, humans speak ill
of each other,

308
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,944
they betray each other,
and they hate each other.

309
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,160
But at a funeral,

310
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,789
they forget all the hatred
they had for the other.

311
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:47,145
They even remember
the good times they had together.

312
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:48,954
Right?

313
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:53,111
You have to be kidding me!
No! Please don't do it.

314
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:54,302
Hey!

315
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,469
Let me go!

316
00:24:56,511 --> 00:25:00,557
It's a done deal then.
Let's have a big funeral for Rokusuke.

317
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:01,975
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

318
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,183
Come on!

319
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,560
Hurry up!

320
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,565
Is that gold?
There's nothing shiny about it.

321
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,135
They have to melt that ore with mercury.

322
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,879
After that, they evaporate the mercury,
and only then do they get pure gold.

323
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:49,155
I don't get it.

324
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:51,876
Well, there is no need
for you to understand it.

325
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:01,408
Oh!

326
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:05,330
Huh? What are you doing
Hurry up!

327
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:06,797
If you don't hurry up,

328
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:09,387
I'll ask the boss to hold
a funeral for you!

329
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,768
Please forgive me!

330
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:17,008
I'm getting really mad now.
I won't forgive them!

331
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,551
Calm down, Naruto...

332
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,981
We don't know anything
about them yet.

333
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,599
That's right. We should do
what Neji is telling us.

334
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,816
Yeah, but...

335
00:26:26,148 --> 00:26:29,568
if we don't do something,
that poor old guy is going to die!

336
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,657
Naruto, leave this to me.

337
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:33,309
Wait, Lee!

338
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,200
Hey, hey.
Hurry up and pick them up!

339
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,177
Yeah! Way to go, Lee!

340
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,047
Are you okay, old man?

341
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,886
Oh my gosh!
What have you done?!

342
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:04,360
Here. Drink some water.

343
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:08,590
What are you doing?!

344
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,771
I beg you.
Please punch me, kick me.

345
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,181
Please knock me around

346
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,846
like the way you just did
with those guys.

347
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,609
What are you saying?

348
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:19,487
If you won't do it,
I'll do it myself!

349
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:22,137
What are you doing?!

350
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:23,442
Stop!

351
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,149
I'm scared.

352
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:27,386
Just think what they'll do

353
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,356
if they find out I was
the only one who was safe.

354
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,400
What was that sound?

355
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,134
Did they find us?

356
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:45,571
Oh my, that's the sound
of the funeral bell.

357
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,159
Funeral?

358
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah.

359
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:53,728
Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family
which rules this town,

360
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,217
arranges a funeral for
those who betray him.

361
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,410
He buries them alive.

362
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:01,706
What? They bury them alive?
That's so cruel!

363
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,141
Yeah, but...

364
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,828
Raiga always cries sadly
during the funeral.

365
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,748
That's one weird guy.

366
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,172
But...

367
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:16,961
That doesn't seem to be
the sound of the bell for you.

368
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:21,787
Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke
was caught this morning, so...

369
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:23,707
What?!

370
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:04,175
I'm so happy, I remember
the first day I met that guy.

371
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,178
Yeah? That's nice.

372
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:14,185
Yeah... When I told him we were taking
over the mountain from the magistrate,

373
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:19,107
he was so relieved to be freed from
the high taxes that he was paying.

374
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:26,823
He was laughing out of pure joy...
He was a really nice guy.

375
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:32,172
I like funerals.
Makes me feel nostalgic.

376
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:36,015
Would you put on
a big funeral for me too?

377
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:39,332
Fool! I'm not putting on
a funeral for you.

378
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,430
You are not going
to die before me.

379
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:45,800
I don't have to have a funeral for you
to think of the good times

380
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,660
because you are always a good boy.

381
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:52,657
Raiga.

382
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:54,282
What is it?

383
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:59,565
They're coming.
They'll show up anytime now.

384
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:05,228
Yeah... I'm excited to see
what kind of help he sought.

385
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:10,950
Okay! Let's save the guy.

386
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,191
Let's do it, Neji.

387
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,449
Okay.

388
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:17,082
<i>Byakugan!</i>

389
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:27,717
It's all right. He's still alive.

390
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,201
If we can get rid of
the guys around him,

391
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:31,804
we can save him.

392
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:34,811
Okay! Let's get rid
of them quickly!

393
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:35,802
Yeah!

394
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,226
Okay, let's go!

395
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:43,747
No! Let me out!

396
00:30:58,915 --> 00:30:59,843
An enemy attack!

397
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:07,985
You...!

398
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,718
Tenten, you take the right!

399
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:11,912
Okay!

400
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:25,976
<i>Gentle Fist!</i>

401
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,700
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

402
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:40,665
Na-ru-to...

403
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,044
Uzumaki Barrage!

404
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:53,886
That's the way!

405
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,388
- Watch out!
- Huh?

406
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:56,931
There are three more!

407
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,191
Here comes the Leaf Village's
handsome devil, Rock Lee!

408
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,088
I found the last one!

409
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:18,867
You are...

410
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,205
Who is this guy?

411
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,539
Well...

412
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,114
This is Karashi.

413
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,423
The one Grandma Sansho
was talking about...

414
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,938
This is Karashi?

415
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:37,410
Karashi, was it your own decision
to join the Kurosuki Family...

416
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,807
just like Grandma Sansho said it was?

417
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,268
So what if it was?

418
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:43,590
What?!

419
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:46,321
Sir Raiga is great!

420
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,358
He overthrew the corrupt magistrate
of the Katabami Gold Mine,

421
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,469
and he liberated everybody
from the village!

422
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,864
Karashi, did you know that

423
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,786
Grandma Sansho worries about you
everyday while cooking curry?

424
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,666
Naruto, leave things to me here.

425
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:09,962
Karashi, you saved my life
with your curry of life.

426
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:13,468
If you can make such
a wonderful curry,

427
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,647
how can you serve a man
who has no respect for life?!

428
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:17,910
Why?

429
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,413
Nobody cares to compliment me
even if I can make that curry.

430
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,520
As a man born in this world,

431
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,773
I should gain more power and
try to take over the world!

432
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:33,199
Instead of rotting away in that shop
that no one ever goes to.

433
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:36,561
What? I can't take this anymore!

434
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:45,747
Lee!

435
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:53,977
Karashi, not only did you and
Grandma Sansho's curry save my life...

436
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:57,580
But you also taught me that
if you make it from the heart,

437
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,012
just one serving of curry
could save lives,

438
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:06,269
and that even someone like me could
achieve anything if I just work hard enough.

439
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:13,094
You looked much stronger
and dignified then than you do now.

440
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:23,068
Please promise me...
Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!

441
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:29,289
You're right...

442
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,767
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry!

443
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:35,339
Oh, I'm so relieved.

444
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:39,184
Hey! Please get me out of here.

445
00:34:39,302 --> 00:34:41,429
It's dark and I can't breathe.

446
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:43,139
Oh yeah!

447
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:46,086
We almost forgot about Rokusuke.

448
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,941
Mmm? You guys...

449
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:56,328
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's all right now.

450
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,295
I'm sorry. Thinking that maybe

451
00:35:00,394 --> 00:35:02,688
I could still save my friend
who got buried alive...

452
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:04,942
I just couldn't stay still.

453
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:08,050
Yeah, I understand.

454
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,197
Neji, what is it?

455
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:25,930
What is this?

456
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:28,454
This ominous presence...

457
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:33,898
Hey Neji, what is it?

458
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:37,818
We are being watched.
It's probably Raiga.

459
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:38,786
What?

460
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,620
From the top of that cliff...

461
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,066
Okay. Let's go!

462
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:46,346
Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.

463
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:47,577
All right.

464
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:57,792
No one's here.

465
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,256
Where did he go?

466
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,514
Mmm? What is that?

467
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,521
This mist...

468
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,862
<i>Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!</i>

469
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,049
Neji, try to find the enemy
with your Byakugan.

470
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,643
I've been trying...!

471
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,753
I... can't see a thing!

472
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:41,048
That's impossible.
Even Neji's Byakugan

473
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:45,344
with its 360-degree vision is useless!

474
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,722
What's going on?

475
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:51,181
There shouldn't be a jutsu
that can defeat the Byakugan!

476
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,863
What do you think, Ranmaru?

477
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,411
It's amazing...

478
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:14,290
One of them can see
the chakra network itself.

479
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:18,210
He probably has some sort
of Kekkei Genkai power.

480
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:19,897
He can see us?

481
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:24,258
It's all right,
my power is superior to his...

482
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:26,801
So, what are you going to do?

483
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,079
Everybody in the Katabami
Gold Mine is depending on me.

484
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:37,579
I am the one who must maintain
peace in this village.

485
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,024
Are you going to hold a funeral?

486
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:46,155
No, even if I hold a funeral,
I have no memories of them.

487
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,757
I'll just get rid of them!

488
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:54,040
Watch,
<i>Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!</i>

489
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,425
Wh-What is it?!

490
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,767
Lighting, strike!

491
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,544
They blew up...
They blew up and died!

492
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:46,048
As I expected, I'm not sad.

493
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:49,015
I suppose you can't hold a proper
funeral when you feel nothing...

494
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:57,122
Four of them are still alive.

495
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:01,188
Can't be! After being hit
by my Lightning Fang...

496
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,289
No...

497
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,068
If you say so, it has to be true.

498
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,487
He's going to be a problem...

499
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:18,372
<i>The enemy was nearby...
But I couldn't see anything.</i>

500
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:21,374
<i>It's strange...</i>

501
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,658
<i>Even if it's the Hidden Mist Jutsu,</i>

502
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,797
<i>my Byakugan should be able
to see through it.</i>

503
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:29,266
<i>Byakugan!</i>

504
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,759
For sure this time...

505
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:36,764
I can see it!

506
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,393
Two targets, 52 degrees to the southwest!

507
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:44,273
Three targets, 12 degrees to the southeast!

508
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:48,569
One target, 8 degrees to the southeast!

509
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:53,532
Another target at 24 degrees
to the northwest!

510
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,053
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

511
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,541
Let's go!

512
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:07,379
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

513
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,259
<i>No way!</i>

514
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,599
<i>Why?!</i>

515
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,859
Uzumaki Barrage!

516
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,820
I missed!

517
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,657
H-Help me!

518
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,034
Bushy Brow?

519
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,288
Th-The enemy disappeared!

520
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:55,844
<i>It can't be...
False images with chakra networks?</i>

521
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:02,726
One at the middle of the cliff,
one at the bottom of the cliff,

522
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:05,646
one on the right, one on the left.

523
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:08,357
We can't hold funerals,

524
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:11,652
but I'll take care of them
without a trace.

525
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,034
<i>Thunder Funeral: Banquet of Lightning!</i>

526
00:41:34,147 --> 00:41:36,191
The corpses are warm.

527
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,788
We're strong... you and me.

528
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:43,726
No, it's you.

529
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:49,857
Ranmaru, you're strong.
With you, I'm also strong.

530
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,862
Wait... They aren't dead yet.
They're just unconscious.

531
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:57,541
They're stubborn.

532
00:41:58,169 --> 00:42:01,702
Alright, if frying them doesn't work,
then we'll chop them to pieces.

533
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:06,915
Flesh and even bone...
I'll crush them nicely.

534
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:13,547
Ranmaru...! Are you all right?!

535
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:21,055
Hang in there, Ranmaru!

536
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:22,513
Ranmaru...!

537
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,449
I'm okay.

538
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:28,603
Raiga...

539
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:31,940
This person... is still unconscious.

540
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,591
What did you say?

541
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:38,364
It's amazing...

542
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,283
He's fighting
with only muscle memory.

543
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,120
What a fine face.
It's seared into my very soul.

544
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:48,706
Let's hold a funeral for him...

545
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:51,710
I am sure it will be one
that will make me cry!

546
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:53,127
From the right!

547
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:54,797
What's with this guy...?

548
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,840
He's hard to read his moves...

549
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,135
But for your sake, Raiga,
I'll do my best.

550
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,638
Together, okay!

551
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:03,524
Left!

552
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:04,181
Right!

553
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:05,849
From the front! Jump! Now!

554
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:12,439
You... you... you!

555
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:14,367
What?

556
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,886
How is this guy... still moving?

557
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,334
B-Bushy Brows...

558
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:44,471
<i>Lee...
Could he have lost consciousness...?</i>

559
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:46,598
Tenten! Neji!

560
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:57,002
Raiga! Turn around!

561
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:00,039
What? That voice just now...?

562
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:04,032
Wha-?!

563
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:05,534
Raiga!

564
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:06,958
Ranmaru!

565
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:09,444
This is...

566
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:10,586
Neji...

567
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:11,789
Ranmaru!

568
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:12,905
Move!

569
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:18,714
Huh? Somehow... it felt like
I was fighting in my dreams...

570
00:44:21,216 --> 00:44:22,259
Ranmaru...

571
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:27,903
You!

572
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,439
Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives!

573
00:44:36,231 --> 00:44:37,231
Naruto...

574
00:44:37,453 --> 00:44:39,580
Just die already...

575
00:44:39,735 --> 00:44:42,905
Hey! I have something
I want to ask you!

576
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:46,742
You... I heard you're one of
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

577
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:52,581
So what if I was?!

578
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:55,147
You know Zabuza, right?!

579
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:57,194
You also know...
someone called Kisame, right?!

580
00:44:58,253 --> 00:45:03,175
I despise them!
I don't want to remember them!

581
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,177
I hate you too!

582
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,887
Then!

583
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,872
Then I'll make you talk by force!

584
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:13,684
A clone?!

585
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,189
You... You're weaker
than you were a moment ago.

586
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:22,194
Wh-What...?

587
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:23,617
<i>Lightning Ball!</i>

588
00:45:32,955 --> 00:45:33,955
Damn...

589
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,167
Huh, you are tough...

590
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:38,890
<i>Lightning Ball!</i>

591
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:47,218
Naruto!

592
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,556
It's not... working at all.

593
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:06,015
I'm not going to
remember your smile!

594
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:07,304
Die!

595
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:12,496
Ranmaru... where are you?

596
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:16,665
What's in this bag...?

597
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,458
<i>Byakugan!</i>

598
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,536
There's... someone...

599
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:33,306
Could it be?

600
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:46,153
This powder...
was it obscuring their chakra networks?

601
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,244
It's even creating the chakra network!

602
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,670
Naruto!
Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

603
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:07,829
But he saw all the shadow clones...

604
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:11,178
Don't worry.
His eyes are right here!

605
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,508
Ranmaru! I'm gonna come save you
after I defeat this guy!

606
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,501
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

607
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:24,232
Bring it on!

608
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,861
<i>Lightning Ball!</i>

609
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,990
What? Was that last one just a lucky shot?

610
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:36,328
Stop messing around.
All I have to do is defeat you all, right?

611
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,372
Let's go!

612
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,334
We're not done yet!

613
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,669
You...

614
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:47,547
<i>At this rate... my chakra will...</i>

615
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:52,135
<i>The mist...
The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away...</i>

616
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:54,429
<i>Damn it! I'll finish them all at once!</i>

617
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:57,223
Damn it!

618
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:04,022
I'm not going to let you get away!

619
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:08,735
Wait!

620
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:11,571
<i>Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche</i>

621
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:18,577
Naruto!

622
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,499
Naruto...

623
00:48:31,004 --> 00:48:31,838
Did you see that?!

624
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:33,093
Yeah, I saw it!

625
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,762
Prepare yourself!

626
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:37,263
Stop it!

627
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,685
I can't stop!

628
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:53,363
I... did it.

629
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:57,701
This is Raiga's eye...?

630
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:02,330
Such a big eyeball!

631
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:03,355
Huh?

632
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:05,070
Idiot...
It's a human being!

633
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:10,889
Huh?!

634
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:14,092
In my dream...

635
00:49:14,176 --> 00:49:17,345
I guess you were the one
I was fighting against.

636
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,792
It wasn't me...
It was Raiga and me together...

637
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:22,303
Together...?

638
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:25,854
Always... since back then...

639
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:04,768
Don't act like you're asleep.
You are going to die...

640
00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:07,429
Don't move!

641
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:12,288
There is a spy in this village
who snuck into the Hidden Mist Village...

642
00:50:12,313 --> 00:50:15,316
We came to kill those guys, but...

643
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:22,395
I lost track of who I was supposed to kill.
So, I just started killing randomly...

644
00:50:25,412 --> 00:50:28,415
Wh-What are you saying?

645
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:35,173
It's fine...
If I am going to be killed by you.

646
00:50:35,843 --> 00:50:39,638
Huh...?
Why is it fine for me to kill you...?

647
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:43,470
You were... always crying...

648
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:46,476
Huh? Me... cry?

649
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:52,190
In your heart... you were searching
for a reason to live.

650
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:57,737
I was always watching... you.

651
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,741
What... are you?

652
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:07,554
I am the same as you...
living is painful.

653
00:51:08,081 --> 00:51:10,125
I don't understand
the meaning of living.

654
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:13,545
Because of my sickness,
I couldn't go outside...

655
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:15,841
Shunned by everyone,

656
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:18,758
all I could do was to take
a peek of the world from this blanket...

657
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:21,928
But... if with my death,

658
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:27,000
if you are able to feel
the meaning of life even a little...

659
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:32,981
My life was not needed
from the beginning.

660
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:37,693
Please...

661
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,089
Are you... alone?

662
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:48,733
Come with me.

663
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:55,795
From now on,
you and I are two as one.

664
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:06,306
From that day on,
I became Raiga's eyes and ears.

665
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,020
Raiga became my hands and feet.

666
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,321
The outside world that I dashed
into for the very first time...

667
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:26,660
it was filled with things
I had never seen or heard before.

668
00:52:27,995 --> 00:52:29,205
It was fun.

669
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:37,207
Whenever and wherever,
I was with Raiga.

670
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:39,756
No matter when it was,

671
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,451
there wasn't a time
that we were separated.

672
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:16,418
We were trying to find the meaning of life
by living for each other.

673
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:19,846
We were convinced that was
our reason for living.

674
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:30,551
That's why...

675
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:33,336
If Raiga is not around,

676
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:37,188
I no longer have the power
to live by myself.

677
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:40,567
I've lost the purpose to live...

678
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:46,072
<i>Do you have someone
precious to you?</i>

679
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:49,784
<i>I want to protect
someone important to me...</i>

680
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:54,372
<i>I want to make his dream come true,
and that's my dream.</i>

681
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:58,209
I no longer need to live.

682
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,841
Don't say such stupid things.

683
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,469
<i>What are you doing?</i>

684
00:54:10,276 --> 00:54:12,737
<i>Now, quickly.</i>

685
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:16,249
Why are you hesitating...?

686
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:21,066
With no arms or legs,
I have no way to resist.

687
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:27,614
You should carry out your mission...

688
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,250
Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.

689
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,734
Our mission is to drive the
Kurosuki Family out of this village...

690
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:43,963
Without Raiga, he cannot be
of any threat to this village.

691
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:49,500
The problem right now is that

692
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:52,263
the Kurosuki Family members
have lost their leadership.

693
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:56,474
With their leader gone,
there's no telling what they'll do.

694
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:05,443
For this mission...
this is the finishing touch.

695
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,950
Yeah, but what are we
going to do with him?

696
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,552
Is he a villain worth tying up?

697
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,588
No, he is not.

698
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:28,269
He might kill himself, right?

699
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:33,054
Once the mission is over,
we will come save you right away...

700
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:41,688
A chakra sealing tag?

701
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,448
We can't help it.
He is an enemy, after all...

702
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:51,200
We should assume he has other jutsu.
Just in case!

703
00:56:08,171 --> 00:56:09,589
Hey...

704
00:56:11,488 --> 00:56:12,572
Here they come!

705
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,679
Naruto! Don't come...

706
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:17,184
If you value your life,
be quiet.

707
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:18,933
Karashi...

708
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,702
I heard that you were deeply sorry
for your actions...!

709
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,899
How can I go back to the curry shop
with no shame?!

710
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:28,932
Now!

711
00:56:57,682 --> 00:56:58,682
Did you see that?!

712
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:03,318
Even without Master Raiga,
the Kurosuki Family is eternal!

713
00:57:05,364 --> 00:57:07,867
Hey... what are you looking for?

714
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:11,020
Isn't it obvious? The brats!

715
00:57:11,747 --> 00:57:13,332
Are you referring to us?

716
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:14,226
What?!

717
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:23,137
What you crushed were our forms

718
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:26,334
made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu.

719
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,198
Take formation!

720
00:57:31,063 --> 00:57:33,191
<i>Ninja Art: Black Tornado!</i>

721
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,653
Wha?

722
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:28,281
Those were also made by

723
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:30,346
the Shadow Clone Jutsu
and the Transformation Jutsu!

724
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,931
We saw through everything!

725
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,321
Here I go.

726
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,219
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

727
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,930
Disperse!

728
00:59:16,694 --> 00:59:17,694
<i>Byakugan!</i>

729
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:29,457
<i>2 Palms! 4 Palms!</i>

730
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,291
<i>8 Palms!</i>

731
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:31,541
<i>16 Palms!</i>

732
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:36,130
<i>32 Palms!</i>

733
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,300
<i>8 Trigrams 64 Palms!</i>

734
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:45,723
Here I come!
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

735
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:54,275
<i>Clone Spinning Axe Kick!</i>

736
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,205
Huh?! Oww...

737
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:02,490
It's already over...

738
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,485
What?! Not fair!

739
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:07,820
Man! You could've saved
some for me!

740
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:11,344
Just when I thought
I'd try the new jutsu!

741
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:19,924
Man, you never learn, do you!

742
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:22,610
Karashi, are you prepared?

743
01:00:23,505 --> 01:00:24,673
I was just kidding!

744
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,325
How dare you torment us!

745
01:00:27,597 --> 01:00:29,477
You really think we'll let this go
as a joke?

746
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:33,198
I couldn't help it! If I didn't listen,

747
01:00:33,312 --> 01:00:35,773
I would have gotten killed
by the Kurosuki family.

748
01:00:36,243 --> 01:00:37,953
In place of the Kurosuki family,

749
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:40,480
I'll crack your head
with this hammer!

750
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
Yeah! Yeah!

751
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,264
I'm sorry...

752
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,659
Please move, Lee!

753
01:00:47,201 --> 01:00:50,288
Please hit me until
you guys are satisfied.

754
01:00:50,455 --> 01:00:51,789
Why you?

755
01:00:52,505 --> 01:00:55,752
It's partly my responsibility

756
01:00:56,263 --> 01:01:00,173
that the once kind-hearted Karashi
went and joined a gang.

757
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,467
Yours?

758
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:04,135
Because of me,

759
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:06,471
he got the impression
that power is everything.

760
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,449
Right, that's right!

761
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:10,989
Though I knew that it's a bad thing,
I just had to...

762
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:12,477
You be quiet!

763
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:15,500
Karashi is still inexperienced.

764
01:01:15,768 --> 01:01:20,022
But he has skills to make curry
that can save people's lives.

765
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:24,066
Please give Karashi the opportunity
to make amends by making curry.

766
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:30,480
If Karashi goes astray again,
then I will...!

767
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,458
Punish him with my fists!

768
01:01:38,169 --> 01:01:41,059
Everyone, what do you think

769
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:43,795
about letting Lee and Grandma Sansho
take care of this situation...

770
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,655
After all, he was just
an underling of the Kurosuki family.

771
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,017
It's not like he directly
attacked us or anything...

772
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:58,022
Let's have Lee educate him harshly...

773
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:00,107
In that case...

774
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,704
Thank you very much!

775
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:08,829
Th-Thank you...

776
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:11,902
And with this, our mission is complete.

777
01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:13,697
No, not yet...

778
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:14,533
Huh?

779
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:34,914
Are you all right?

780
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:38,729
What's the point of being all right?

781
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,663
I can't live alone.

782
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:43,842
Don't say that!

783
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:45,945
Why don't we just leave this weakling
behind!

784
01:02:46,151 --> 01:02:48,404
Everyone has to live alone!

785
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:52,333
But don't you need friends
who can help you and stuff...?

786
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:56,807
I'm talking about the basics!
I hate people who are indecisive!

787
01:02:58,057 --> 01:03:00,518
I was frail from the time I was born.

788
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,256
That shabby cabin was
the entire world for me.

789
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:12,383
I have no memory of my parents...

790
01:03:12,678 --> 01:03:14,847
I survived only by
the small amount of food

791
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:18,751
that the villagers sometimes
brought me...

792
01:03:22,356 --> 01:03:27,278
But even someone like me
had a power that no one else did.

793
01:03:47,538 --> 01:03:48,538
Here you go.

794
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:51,066
Thank you...

795
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:54,990
Is your leg okay?
The one you cut with the scythe?

796
01:03:55,393 --> 01:03:57,604
D-Did I tell you that story?!

797
01:03:58,184 --> 01:04:00,478
No... I kind of found out...

798
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:06,429
How? No one else besides me
came today or yesterday, right?

799
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:09,365
No, I just saw it from here...

800
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:12,789
Scary!

801
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:17,470
As time went by everyone began
to fear me since I had the power

802
01:04:17,495 --> 01:04:20,776
to know what was happening outside
even from my room.

803
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:25,002
<i>Did you know?!</i>

804
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,130
<i>I heard that Ranmaru has
the ability to see everything...</i>

805
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:31,133
<i>Were we being spied on every day?</i>

806
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:35,429
Get out of the village!

807
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:37,181
You monster!

808
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,506
And so I had no more visitors...

809
01:04:41,693 --> 01:04:43,570
All I could do was to wait to die.

810
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,234
That's when Raiga saved me...

811
01:04:54,443 --> 01:04:56,778
I see. What a bitter past.

812
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:58,995
Yes, it is.

813
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:00,526
Hmm...

814
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:05,848
Raiga took me out to
the unknown world.

815
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:13,756
<i>Ranmaru, try opening your eyes...</i>

816
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:22,175
<i>This is the outside world where
we'll be living from now on... okay?</i>

817
01:05:23,144 --> 01:05:24,144
<i>Okay...</i>

818
01:05:27,398 --> 01:05:32,069
If Raiga isn't here,
it's the same as losing my body.

819
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,201
Perhaps Raiga became known

820
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:38,403
as one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist

821
01:05:38,752 --> 01:05:41,560
because he was able
to borrow your power.

822
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:44,665
It seems like you two
helped each other to live...

823
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:46,458
Yes.

824
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,169
That's not true!

825
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,540
You were being used for
Raiga's evil deeds!

826
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,926
I might have been... used...

827
01:05:57,011 --> 01:06:03,476
But good or evil doesn't matter to me.
I was just his senses...

828
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:07,627
Then that won't mean
that you're really living!

829
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:08,887
Huh?

830
01:06:09,515 --> 01:06:13,144
See, you have to do your best
to live from now on!

831
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:17,615
First, eat the Curry of Life
and get your strength back!

832
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:20,053
That's right!
You will get nourishment.

833
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:24,201
Won't that just make him sicker?

834
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:27,708
Naruto, you can't eat it either, right?

835
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,903
Actually, the more I eat it,

836
01:06:30,947 --> 01:06:34,117
the more energized my body feels...

837
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:37,581
That curry saved my life, you know!

838
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:43,319
Until the day you're able
to walk alone,

839
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:45,392
I will become your body!

840
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:46,643
Okay?

841
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:50,209
I have one favor to ask...

842
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:51,207
Huh?

843
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:07,831
<i>Byakugan!</i>

844
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,189
As I expected...
I can no longer see life in Raiga.

845
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:23,791
Can you see, Ranmaru?

846
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:26,679
Yes.

847
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:33,796
Is this okay?

848
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,175
Yes...

849
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,737
Let's go... The mission is complete.

850
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,138
Hey!

851
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:54,710
What?

852
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
That's!

853
01:07:58,424 --> 01:08:01,218
One, two, one, two.

854
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:02,921
Grandma Sansho!

855
01:08:03,556 --> 01:08:08,185
What's all this ruckus?!
Dust will go into the curry.

856
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:11,282
L-Lee and the others came back!

857
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:13,789
K-Karashi is with them!

858
01:08:14,578 --> 01:08:16,872
Is it worth the ruckus?

859
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,779
Grandma, aren't you happy?

860
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:23,571
One, two... One, two...

861
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,811
Your snot will go in!

862
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,768
Grandma Sansho! I'm back!

863
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,335
Karashi is here too!

864
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:47,264
M-Mom, sorry!
Please forgive me!

865
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:49,809
Please forgive him...

866
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:52,117
He says he'll devote himself
from now on,

867
01:08:52,188 --> 01:08:56,025
and train to take over
the Curry of Life Shop, so please...

868
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:03,989
First you gotta eat...

869
01:09:04,286 --> 01:09:04,959
Huh...

870
01:09:07,134 --> 01:09:08,927
Wow, it looks good!

871
01:09:09,161 --> 01:09:11,789
If you're not going to eat, I will!

872
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:15,177
I've prepared some for each of you...

873
01:09:15,855 --> 01:09:19,442
Oh my, that's a very pale child.

874
01:09:19,673 --> 01:09:22,801
Yeah, can you prepare
some for him too?

875
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:24,423
Especially mild...

876
01:09:25,307 --> 01:09:27,392
I prefer mild too...

877
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:29,085
Oh my...

878
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:37,690
Mom... thanks for the food!

879
01:09:41,255 --> 01:09:44,467
This is the "Punishment x300" curry...

880
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:50,160
It's spicy, it's spicy...

881
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,055
But it's good! It's good, Mom!

882
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:01,155
Here, I have some for everybody!
