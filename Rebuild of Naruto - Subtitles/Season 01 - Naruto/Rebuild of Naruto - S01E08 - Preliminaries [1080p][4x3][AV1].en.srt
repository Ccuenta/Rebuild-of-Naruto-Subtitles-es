1
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,809
Huh? What's this?

2
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:42,332
A man...?

3
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:43,841
A person...?

4
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,274
This is... a Summoning Jutsu!

5
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:51,510
Naruto! Sakura!
Let go of the scroll!

6
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,653
Oh...

7
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:00,486
Wha?!

8
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,314
Y-You...

9
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,462
Hi!

10
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:10,999
It's been a long time.

11
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,969
Congratulations on surviving
the second test!

12
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,764
To celebrate your passing,

13
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,409
I'd like to treat you to
some Ichiraku ramen, but...

14
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,812
Ohh... Cool!

15
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,896
Uh oh...

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,439
H-Hey, Naruto!

17
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,608
- Listen to the end...
- Cool! Cool!

18
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:34,546
Ramen! Ramen, y'know!

19
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:38,049
I've done a great job!
I'm the greatest!

20
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,151
I so want to eat ramen, y'know!

21
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,913
He's got so much energy.

22
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,022
Yaaaay!

23
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,260
Shut up!

24
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:52,678
Man, you haven't change a bit,
still as scatterbrained as ever.

25
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,493
Oh yeah, Sensei!

26
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:55,277
Huh?

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,052
By the way,
what are the letters on that wall?

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,780
They're kind of squiggly and

29
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,266
we don't understand
their meaning at all.

30
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,394
Never mind, never mind!

31
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,549
We passed!

32
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,212
No... explaining that is
also part of my duties.

33
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,905
What, really?

34
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,115
That's right.

35
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:21,932
Give it a read.

36
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,665
These are Chunin instructions
Lord Hokage recorded.

37
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,493
Instructions?!

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,750
That's right!

39
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,713
Heaven in this text
refers to the human head.

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,216
Earth refers to the human body.

41
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,259
No kidding...

42
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:39,890
"If you lack Heaven,

43
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,871
gain knowledge and await your opportunity."

44
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,265
In other words...

45
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,102
If your weaknesses are
inside your head, Naruto...

46
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,773
learn various strategies to
prepare for your missions.

47
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,201
Huh! So troublesome!

48
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,612
"If you lack Earth,

49
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,320
run across the land
to gain your advantage."

50
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,409
If your weaknesses are in
your physical strength, Sakura,

51
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:09,123
it means you must not
slack off on your daily training.

52
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,796
And if you combine both
Heaven and Earth...

53
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,752
Even a perilous mission can become
manageable...

54
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,936
In other words...

55
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,429
that is how this principle
ensures a safe mission.

56
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,432
Then, what about
the spot with the missing letter?

57
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:30,226
The letter refers to Chunin.

58
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,984
The "person" character from
your scroll goes there.

59
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:38,920
These five days of survival
were to test

60
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,490
the candidates' fundamental
abilities as Chunin.

61
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,077
And you guys cleared it splendidly.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,247
Chunin are unit leaders.

63
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:51,818
They have the responsibility
of leading a team.

64
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,253
Be more deeply aware of
the necessity of physical strength...

65
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:59,571
and knowledge in missions!

66
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:03,486
I want you to take on
the next step,

67
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,762
never forgetting these
Chunin instructions.

68
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:10,898
That is the extent of the message
I was tasked to deliver.

69
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,614
Got it!

70
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:26,052
But for the third and final test,
don't overdo it.

71
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,215
Especially you, Naruto.

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,185
You're the one I'm most worried about...

73
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,268
Iruka-sensei.

74
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:33,308
From when I received the
Leaf headband,

75
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,833
I'm not an Academy student anymore,
ya know?!

76
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,213
I'm now...

77
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,344
A ninja!

78
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,098
I see.

79
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:51,223
I'm sorry, Naruto.

80
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,554
<i>I know their strength the best.</i>

81
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>If it's futile anyway,</i>

82
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,207
<i>I would like to be the one
to give them the final word.</i>

83
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:06,611
<i>If you feel that strongly,
I can leave that team to you.</i>

84
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,128
<i>To think you'd plead 
their case so strongly...</i>

85
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,217
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

86
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,876
<i>But, they are Kakashi's team,
are they not?</i>

87
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,270
<i>If he's the one who
recommended them,</i>

88
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,959
<i>I thought I could count on them.</i>

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,601
<i>The one who might truly understand</i>

90
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>the strength of these kids...
is you, Kakashi.</i>

91
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,659
How is it?

92
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,214
Does the Curse Mark still hurt?

93
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,570
No.

94
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,680
Thanks to you,
it's gotten quite a bit better.

95
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:02,505
Anyway, Orochimaru is one
of the three Legendary Sannin, right?

96
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:05,233
He's an S-rank rogue shinobi

97
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,010
that even the ANBU couldn't stop, right?

98
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,264
I heard that he'd already died, but...

99
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,336
Why did he come to this village now...?

100
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,311
He's probably after Sasuke, right?

101
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,572
Huh?!

102
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:20,775
Master Anko!

103
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:24,388
Twenty-one candidates have 
successfully passed the second test.

104
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:28,089
As for the third test, according
to the regulations of the Chunin Exam,

105
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,452
For the first time in five years,
we're holding preliminaries.

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,702
The second test is over.

107
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,791
For the time being,
continue the exam as is,

108
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:42,415
but while keeping
an eye on his movements.

109
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,670
Yes...

110
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:58,182
First off, congratulations on
finishing the second test.

111
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,357
<i>There were seventy-eight
test takers for the second test.</i>

112
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:06,397
<i>To think twenty-one have
made it this far.</i>

113
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>I told them I’d cut the number to less than half...
but I was really aiming for single digits</i>

114
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,214
I'm hungry!

115
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:28,659
There are still this many remaining?

116
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:30,096
This is such a drag.

117
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,808
Sasuke and his team passed, too.

118
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,599
Of course...

119
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,745
Your team didn't do too badly.

120
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,729
I guess they were lucky.

121
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,025
But as long as my team is around,
they won't get any higher.

122
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,858
After all, whether you
like it or not,

123
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,947
true ability is all that matters
from here on.

124
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:53,841
Well, youth can be bittersweet,

125
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,077
and can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi...

126
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,029
Did you say something?

127
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:03,839
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

128
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:09,275
<i>Not bad, my rival Kakashi.</i>

129
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:13,560
<i>But that cool attitude of yours...
That's what so irritating!</i>

130
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,765
<i>So that's Guy-sensei's eternal rival, huh?</i>

131
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:21,143
<i>Guy-sensei really doesn't compare visually...</i>

132
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:25,273
<i>Guy-sensei is the coolest
of all the teachers!</i>

133
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,482
<i>He shines!</i>

134
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,607
<i>Okay!</i>

135
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,154
Please watch, Guy-sensei!
I'll shine, too!

136
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,255
Now then, if you will,
Master Hokage.

137
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,784
All right.

138
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:42,239
Now then, allow me to
explain the third test.

139
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,264
But actually...

140
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:52,717
Please allow me, Hayate Gekko, the proctor
for this test, to have a word first.

141
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,302
I leave it to you...

142
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,389
There's something... I'd like you all
to do...

143
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,432
before the third test.

144
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,027
And that is a preliminary
to the third test,

145
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,958
with a spot in the final rounds
on the line.

146
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:17,357
Preliminary?

147
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,192
What do you mean... preliminary?!

148
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:22,394
This time around,

149
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:25,705
perhaps because the first and
second tests were easy,

150
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,503
there are a few too many
people left.

151
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:33,002
In accordance with the rules
of the Chunin Exam,

152
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,253
a preliminary will be held in order to
reduce the number advancing.

153
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,524
N-No way!

154
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,593
Many guests will be coming
to the third test.

155
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,913
Our time is limited, so we can't have long,
drawn-out matches.

156
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,362
Therefore, those of you
not in top physical condition...

157
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:56,865
Excuse me.

158
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:02,379
Those of you who wish to drop out,
please speak up now.

159
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,721
The preliminary will
begin immediately, so...

160
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,529
Immediately, you say...?!

161
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:11,817
But we finally made it through
the second test.

162
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:13,898
What a drag...

163
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,258
Huh? What about our meal?

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,335
<i>Okay!</i>

165
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,746
<i>I'm going to do my best, no matter what!</i>

166
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,138
<i>I promised Kabuto, too...</i>

167
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:25,751
Well...

168
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:28,864
Excuse me... I'll quit.

169
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,399
Let's see...

170
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,560
Kabuto Yakushi of
the Leaf Village, correct?

171
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,271
Then, you may step back.

172
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:40,611
Okay.

173
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,267
Kabuto!

174
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,340
Why're you quitting?!

175
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,019
Tell me! Why?!

176
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,045
I'm sorry, Naruto...

177
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,987
But my body is worn out.

178
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,466
Actually before the first test...

179
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,490
when I clashed with those
guys from the Sound Village,

180
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
I've had no hearing at all in my left ear.

181
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,058
To fight again right away...

182
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,396
and put my life on the line...
I just can't do it.

183
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:17,392
I've seen that face a few times.

184
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,571
Anko.

185
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,906
Uh... yes.

186
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,785
Kabuto Yakushi.

187
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,925
According to the data, he has failed
the exam six times in a row.

188
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,371
What about his background?

189
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,562
From his time at the Academy,

190
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,422
he was a student who did
not really stand out,

191
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,049
and his grades were ordinary.

192
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,135
He finally passed the graduation
exam on his third try.

193
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:44,242
After that, as for the missions
he carried out,

194
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,436
two C-rank and 
fourteen D-rank missions.

195
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,311
It's not an impressive service record.

196
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,605
However...

197
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,441
However?

198
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,585
Do you remember the story...

199
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:03,096
about the boy who was brought back
from the battle of Kikyo Pass?

200
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,701
I remember.

201
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,206
As I recall, I heard that a boy, an enemy
survivor, was found at the battlefield

202
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:15,130
was taken in by a Jonin from
the medical unit.

203
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,838
So he's that boy...?

204
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,864
<i>My information-gathering role
has served its purpose...</i>

205
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,135
<i>Master Orochimaru.</i>

206
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,932
<i>I'll save the real fun for later...</i>

207
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,267
<i>Sasuke...</i>

208
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,561
<i>And Naruto...</i>

209
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,729
<i>You too.</i>

210
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,818
<i>The waves of pain are
coming faster...</i>

211
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,072
<i>Sasuke... I knew it.</i>

212
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,409
Sasuke, you should quit
the Preliminaries!

213
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,577
Huh?!

214
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,821
L-Look, you haven't been yourself

215
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:54,557
ever since you were attacked
by that Orochimaru guy!

216
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,544
Please...

217
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,341
Please, quit!

218
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,095
I'm... scared.

219
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:11,577
You're in no condition to
fight properly, Sasuke...!

220
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,726
Shut up.

221
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,667
I understand!

222
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,689
Be quiet!

223
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,801
But you've been enduring the pain
this whole time, right?!

224
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,361
Please be quiet!

225
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,989
No matter what you say, Sasuke...

226
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,045
I'm going to tell the proctor
about that mark!

227
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,868
If I do that...

228
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,343
Don't talk about this mark.

229
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:37,543
Why're you acting tough like that?!

230
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,880
I don't want to watch you suffer
all the time anymore!

231
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,048
For me, Sasuke, you are-

232
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:45,479
This has nothing to do with you!

233
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,263
It's none of your business.

234
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,387
This isn't just an exam to me.

235
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,358
Becoming a Chunin has nothing
to do with it for me.

236
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,658
"Am I strong?"
All I want is the answer to that.

237
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,494
I must fight the strong.

238
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,673
And...

239
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:18,983
And they are... here!

240
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:28,513
I will not allow even you
to take my path away from me!

241
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,221
Sasuke...

242
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:33,240
You!

243
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,927
Why are you acting so tough, you idiot?!

244
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,620
And Sakura's so worried about you...!

245
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,645
Naruto!

246
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,400
I want to fight you, too.

247
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,734
Huh?!

248
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,427
I knew it.

249
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,535
What shall we do?

250
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,033
We should remove him from the exam

251
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,401
and isolate him with an ANBU guard.

252
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,654
We should recommend that
he withdraw immediately.

253
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:05,392
He's not the type to
just obey like that!

254
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:09,777
After all, he's of the Uchiha clan.

255
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:11,955
What nonsense are you talking about?!

256
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,800
I'll make him stop, by force if needed!

257
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,952
I will allow Sasuke to take the test...

258
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,423
- and see how things go.
- Wha?!

259
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,100
L-Lord Hokage...!

260
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:22,164
However, if the Curse Mark activates

261
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,833
and the power gets even a little bit
out of control,

262
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,127
get in there and stop it.

263
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,064
All right.

264
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,037
Now then, we will begin the Preliminaries.

265
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:41,258
The upcoming preliminaries
will be one-on-one battles.

266
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,806
In other words, it will be actual combat.

267
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,927
There are now exactly twenty people,
so we will conduct ten battles.

268
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:56,798
The winners will be able to
advance to the third test.

269
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,256
There are no rules at all.

270
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:06,150
You will fight until someone dies,
collapses... or admits defeat.

271
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,613
And if you don't want to die,
admit defeat quickly.

272
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,785
However, If I judge
that a match is over...

273
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,458
Eh... I don't want to needlessly
increase the number of fatalities,

274
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,394
so I may intervene and stop the match.

275
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,297
What holds the key to your destinies is...

276
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,051
Open it.

277
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,937
This.

278
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:49,126
The names of two opponents will be
randomly selected and

279
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,738
displayed on this electronic board.

280
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,825
Now then, let's get right down to it

281
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,412
and announce the two names
for the first battle.

282
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,145
<i>To think it'd be so soon...?!</i>

283
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,684
<i>I couldn't ask for more.</i>

284
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,150
<i>No way!</i>

285
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>Why Sasuke?!</i>

286
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:30,091
Now then, the two displayed on
the board, please come forward.

287
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:40,358
For the first battle, Yoroi Akado and
Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.

288
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:42,825
No objections, right?

289
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,872
- Right.
- No!

290
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,049
<i>The pain won't go away!</i>

291
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>It appears the Curse Mark hurts.</i>

292
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:05,253
Everyone other than the two opponents,
please move to the upper area.

293
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,569
Hey! Kakashi-sensei!

294
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,576
Sasuke!

295
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:22,627
Huh?

296
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:26,012
Don't use the Sharingan.

297
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,585
So you knew?

298
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,996
If that Curse Mark on your neck
gets out of control,

299
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,385
it could endanger your life.

300
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,271
I believe it.

301
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:42,490
If that happens, the match will be stopped.

302
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,743
Because I'll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.

303
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,232
<i>Stopped, you say?!</i>

304
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,611
<i>It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my chakra.</i>

305
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>In other words, in this match,</i>

306
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:03,253
<i>I can hardly use even my regular jutsu,
not to mention the Sharingan!</i>

307
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>However... Yoroi's ability is a
particularly bad match-up for you, Sasuke.</i>

308
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,806
Now then, please begin.

309
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,012
Let's go!

310
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:23,610
Yeah!

311
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:35,354
Oh no!

312
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>My strength...?!</i>

313
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,011
<i>W-What is this?</i>

314
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,047
<i>My physical strength has suddenly...!</i>

315
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,534
You... my chakra...

316
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:29,838
You just noticed now...?

317
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,591
<i>Yes... Yoroi has the unique ability
to absorb chakra.</i>

318
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,220
<i>It's a magnificent art that absorbs
both spiritual and physical energy,</i>

319
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,516
<i>simply by holding his palm against
an opponent's body.</i>

320
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>And, if all of your chakra
is absorbed, Sasuke,</i>

321
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,569
<i>you'll be forced to rely on
the power of my Curse Mark...</i>

322
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,255
<i>You little...!</i>

323
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:17,137
<i>To think you still have strength left...</i>

324
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,604
<i>Especially for a simple test subject.</i>

325
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,706
Sasuke!

326
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,519
You call yourself an Uchiha with that?

327
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:34,892
Don't be looking so lame!

328
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,938
Do your best!

329
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
<i>That's it!</i>

330
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,739
You can't afford to let your guard down!

331
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:54,638
<i>Is this as far as it goes...?</i>

332
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,672
<i>That's my...!</i>

333
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,471
But then... 
this next part is my own creation.

334
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,014
It's over...

335
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,738
<i>I won't be swallowed up...
by this thing...</i>

336
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:28,243
<i>No way!</i>

337
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,544
Here I go!

338
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,350
I'm not done, yet!

339
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,978
<i>Lions Barrage!</i>

340
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,541
There's no need to check.

341
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:27,098
I'm stopping the match from
going any further...

342
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:32,451
Therefore, the winner of the
first battle, Sasuke Uchiha...

343
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,447
passes the Preliminaries!

344
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,764
Yes!

345
00:24:44,456 --> 00:24:46,500
Well. Good job...

346
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,572
Before that Lions Barrage,

347
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,918
your movements were that
of Guy's taijutsu...

348
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:58,413
Sasuke! You, you...

349
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,682
That was a pathetic way to win!

350
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,363
Look at you, all battered up!
You idiot!

351
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:06,246
Man, that loser...

352
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,036
<i>Sasuke... Thank goodness.</i>

353
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,930
<i>Okay, I'll win, too!</i>

354
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,645
<i>For a sequence of
high-speed taijutsu like the Lotus,</i>

355
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,881
<i>it's impossible to learn this
without grueling training</i>

356
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,741
<i>that pushes one to their absolute limit.</i>

357
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,110
<i>No matter how much you
use the Sharingan,</i>

358
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,322
<i>it can't just be mastered in
such a short time...</i>

359
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,700
<i>And his idea for that
finishing move...</i>

360
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:43,291
<i>Kakashi... this boy reminds me
of you as a kid...</i>

361
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,262
It just makes it more interesting!

362
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,875
Yeah! He is Sasuke after all...

363
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,390
<i>This is as far as we'll go...</i>

364
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,787
I'm hungry...

365
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:06,809
W-Wow!

366
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,541
Nothing special.

367
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,074
<i>Magnificent...</i>

368
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:19,540
Sasuke Uchiha...

369
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:23,869
The medical team will provide
the best treatment.

370
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,672
That won't be necessary.

371
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,821
Huh?!

372
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,909
I'll take him under my care...

373
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,705
Now, I'll take you into the back...

374
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,695
and seal the Curse Mark.

375
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,922
Can't it wait until
the preliminaries are over?!

376
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:41,635
I want to watch
the rest of the matches!

377
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:42,894
No!

378
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,186
Don't get so heated.

379
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,954
If we let things progress any further,

380
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,482
the damage might become permanent.

381
00:26:49,768 --> 00:26:52,271
I won't indulge you any further.

382
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,945
Now then, come on...

383
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,835
Umm, now then...

384
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,420
We will get right to it and
begin the second match.

385
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:22,458
Which weakling is it?!

386
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:33,779
Both of you, come forward.

387
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:41,733
We will now begin the second match.

388
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>He's going to fight with those arms?</i>

389
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,460
Now then, please begin.

390
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,797
<i>Now, Zaku...</i>

391
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,460
<i>Let's see how you handle this...</i>

392
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:11,359
If you fight here,
you'll be finished...

393
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,399
Withdraw!

394
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,612
Somehow, this one still works, so...

395
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,120
One arm is enough to take care of you!

396
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,168
You can't beat me with just one arm.

397
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,920
Stop pestering me!

398
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,006
Take this!

399
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,218
<i>Slicing Sound Wave!</i>

400
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:11,696
Okay.

401
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,879
Hang in there.
It'll be over right away.

402
00:29:26,427 --> 00:29:27,762
<i>Sealing Jutsu!</i>

403
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:57,917
Next time, even if that Curse Mark
starts kicking in again...

404
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,925
the power of this Curse Sealing
should suppress it.

405
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:10,183
However, this Sealing Jutsu is founded
on the strength of your will.

406
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:13,574
If something happens like you're
not believing in your own strength

407
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,996
and your will weakens...

408
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:18,908
the Curse Mark will flare up again.

409
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,756
Out of character.

410
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,491
It appears he's quite tired...

411
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,119
To think you've become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu...

412
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,583
You've grown, huh, Kakashi...?

413
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,630
You...

414
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,642
Long time no see, Kakashi.

415
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,812
Orochimaru...

416
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,460
Sorry, but...

417
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:02,708
I have no business with you, Kakashi.

418
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,905
But I do have business
with the boy behind you.

419
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:09,675
Why are you after Sasuke?!

420
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:16,165
How nice. You have one as well,
don't you?

421
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:20,910
You didn't have it before, did you?

422
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,840
I want it, too...

423
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,560
The Uchiha power.

424
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,712
Come on. Get up.

425
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,348
<i>B-Bugs?</i>

426
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,076
<i>They burst through the skin...
from inside his body?!</i>

427
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,668
These things are called Parasitic Insects.

428
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:00,972
They attack their prey in groups
and devour chakra...

429
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,880
When they attack in these numbers...

430
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:06,963
you're finished, make no mistake.

431
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,397
If you use your left arm
technique on me,

432
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,222
I'll simultaneously have the bugs exploit
the opening from behind.

433
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,522
Conversely, if you use
your technique on the bugs,

434
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:19,343
I'll simultaneously exploit the opening...

435
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:25,562
Either way, you won't be able
to get through this.

436
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:30,688
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside.

437
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,483
<i>Man, what a pigheaded kid.</i>

438
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,406
<i>You have potential, boy.</i>

439
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:57,220
<i>If you come with me,
you can become strong.</i>

440
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,588
<i>Follow me.</i>

441
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:12,315
<i>If you come with me,
you can become strong.</i>

442
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,619
<i>No longer...</i>

443
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,186
<i>can I afford
to mess this up!</i>

444
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,093
Don't... underestimate me!

445
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,315
An ace in the hole is something
you keep hidden, is it not?!

446
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,961
<i>So the first half of the battle
was a strategic move</i>

447
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,655
<i>to make us think he couldn't
use his right arm.</i>

448
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,491
<i>Not bad... Zaku.</i>

449
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,831
What's your purpose?

450
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,789
The recently built Sound Village.
That's my village.

451
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:16,634
And I need various pawns
who will obey my every whim.

452
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,058
Take this!

453
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,893
So Sasuke is one of those pieces?

454
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,608
No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.

455
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,112
And the ones who are taking
the exams now...

456
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,658
are mere throwaway pieces.

457
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,252
My arms!

458
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,965
Earlier when I recommended
that you give up...

459
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,511
as a precaution, I instructed the bugs...

460
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:04,185
to block those troublesome air tubes
with their bodies and remain still.

461
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,106
This is what a real ace in the hole is.

462
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:09,899
Punk!

463
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,999
Don't... come any closer... to Sasuke!

464
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,507
Even if you're one of
the Three Sannin...

465
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,344
at the very least,
I'll take you down with me!

466
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,150
What's funny?

467
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,905
You don't truly mean that.

468
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,322
What?

469
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:03,411
There's no point at all in
attempting such a seal.

470
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,164
You understand, don't you?

471
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
The will to relentlessly
pursue a goal,

472
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:13,277
regardless of any obstacle...

473
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,257
He is the possessor of that quality.

474
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,468
He's an avenger...

475
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,013
So you took advantage of that, huh?

476
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,931
However, Sasuke is...

477
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,811
At some point,
he will definitely seek me out...

478
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,481
in search of power.

479
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,654
Oh, and, you're going to kill me?

480
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,823
Why don't you try?

481
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,409
That is, if you can...

482
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,503
<i>Take him down with me?!</i>

483
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,714
<i>Am I an idiot?</i>

484
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,726
It seems... it's over.

485
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,730
The winner! Shino Aburame!

486
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,823
W-What is he, Neji?!

487
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,536
<i>Byakugan!</i>

488
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,127
He's something else!

489
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,714
I can understand him calling bugs
with a Summoning Jutsu...

490
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,968
but he harbors bugs all over his body.

491
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,470
S-Say what?!

492
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,475
He's from the Leaf Village's clan
of insect users.

493
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,811
Speaking of which, I've heard of it...

494
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,939
The story of a clan that,
from the moment they are born,

495
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,025
offers their bodies to insects
as a nest as part of a secret pact.

496
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:03,322
They also fight using these bugs.

497
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,828
So he's... the successor?

498
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,128
<i>The mission was the only thing
that tied us together.</i>

499
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,633
<i>However, I'll even the score for you.</i>

500
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,432
<i>Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed...</i>

501
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:30,943
What?! What?!

502
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,563
So Shino, you were that strong,
weren't you?! Damn it!

503
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:39,125
I always thought he was
a creepy guy, but...

504
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:45,019
S-Shino, good... work...

505
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,792
Hey, you did it!

506
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,869
Yes... I'm counting on you guys, too.

507
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:55,729
<i>He walks back in here acting like he's
the team leader or something! Damn it!</i>

508
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,880
Umm, now then, I would like to
get right to the next match.

509
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,467
Kakashi-sensei!

510
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,093
Yo!

511
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,637
Don't just say "Yo," Kakashi-sensei!

512
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,058
What about Sasuke? Is he okay?

513
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,801
Well, he's fine.

514
00:39:14,045 --> 00:39:15,755
He's sleeping soundly in the infirmary.

515
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,275
<i>However, the ANBU are
standing guard...</i>

516
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:27,821
<i>It's finally my turn.</i>

517
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:32,667
<i>Kankuro, he's totally
underestimating this...</i>

518
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,039
<i>Humph. Idiot...</i>

519
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,088
<i>It's him!</i>

520
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,644
Unlike Yoroi,
I don't underestimate kids.

521
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,651
Let me tell you, once I use my jutsu...

522
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,153
you'd better just give up...

523
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,156
I'll bring it to an end swiftly.

524
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,158
If so, I'll also...

525
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,902
First move, a surefire victory!

526
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,734
I dislocate every joint

527
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:32,940
and with chakra, I can control
my softened body at will.

528
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,976
I'll just keep tightening as long
as you refuse to give up.

529
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,771
I don't know what kind of
ninja tool you'll use...

530
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:44,192
but if I keep this up,
none of your tools will work.

531
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:47,623
I can break your neck right now.

532
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,656
So hurry up and give up.

533
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:53,828
No.

534
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,034
Do you want to die?!

535
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,332
Idiot. You're the one who's
going to die.

536
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,485
His neck is broken.

537
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:11,991
What?

538
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,884
I went a little overboard and
ended up killing you.

539
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,020
W-What?

540
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,566
Okay, now it's my turn.

541
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,076
<i>T-This is a Puppet!</i>

542
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,584
<i>T-That's the real body?</i>

543
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,712
<i>He's... a Puppet Master...</i>

544
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,009
G-Give up!

545
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:58,188
If I crush your bones,
you'll be able to bend even more.

546
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:05,981
<i>For once, I was close to stopping
the match in the middle.</i>

547
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,437
The winner, due to the opponent's
inability to continue,

548
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:11,276
is Kankuro.

549
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:14,573
Two against one, that's
totally unfair!

550
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,435
Is that fair, Kakashi-sensei?!

551
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,632
It's not really against the rules.

552
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:21,491
It's a puppet, after all.

553
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,480
That's the Puppet Master Jutsu.

554
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,678
He's controlling the puppet with chakra.

555
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,437
It's the same as using
a ninja tool like shuriken.

556
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:34,390
Now then, to continue,
we will begin the fourth battle.

557
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,807
Man, nothing but
weirdos all over the place!

558
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,379
Don't you say that!

559
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:41,556
You've got a point.

560
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,166
You, too, Sakura?!

561
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:47,698
This isn't the time to be laughing.

562
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:05,101
I never thought...
I'd be fighting you, Sakura.

563
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,876
And what's more, so soon.

564
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:14,974
<i>Ino was a standout
among the rookie Kunoichi.</i>

565
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:17,403
<i>With Sakura as her opponent,</i>

566
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,015
<i>will she... no.
Can she bring herself to fight seriously?</i>

567
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,018
To think it would be those
two of all people.

568
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:27,050
Things have gotten gloomy.

569
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:29,600
I wonder if Ino'll be okay.

570
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,442
<i>That's for sure.</i>

571
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,070
<i>What are you going to do, Ino?</i>

572
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:40,739
Sakura! Good luck! Don't lose!

573
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:43,820
Begin!

574
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
<i>There!</i>

575
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm... not good at stuff like this.

576
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,621
What about you, Ino?

577
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:31,352
That's no good, considering
your name's Sakura.

578
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:34,659
Listen. There are tricks
to things like this.

579
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,351
You know, as for flower arranging,

580
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:43,808
after you've decided on a main flower,
you add other flowers to decorate.

581
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:46,857
Not every flower can be the main focus.

582
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,820
For example... look.

583
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:53,533
You can see those cosmos
flowers over there, right?

584
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,321
If they were the main flowers...

585
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,115
the thoroughwort flowers
you picked are throwaways!

586
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:04,891
As contrasted with
spring cherry blossoms,

587
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,996
cosmos flowers are also known
as autumn cherry blossoms

588
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:09,847
and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.

589
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,377
Also, they're flowers with
the original meaning of "harmony",

590
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:16,306
So any autumn grass would
go perfectly with them.

591
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:22,361
So? Do I look as nice
as the cosmos flowers?

592
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,054
Hey, hey, am I cute?

593
00:45:27,616 --> 00:45:29,326
Uh... yeah.

594
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,432
Say. What's with the pause?

595
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,108
You look like you're having
so much fun.

596
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:38,841
Billboard Brow!

597
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:45,045
Getting a little full of yourself,
aren't you?

598
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:48,155
Don’t let it go to your head!

599
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:53,648
Ami!

600
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:58,246
Sorry, your head looked so empty, 

601
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:01,114
I mistook you for a vase
and stuck flowers in it.

602
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:03,349
Ino!

603
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:05,992
The shinobi flower, aconite.

604
00:46:06,526 --> 00:46:11,448
It's mildly poisonous,
so you should spit it out.

605
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,191
Sensei!

606
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:22,309
Only the root is poisonous, though.

607
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,620
<i>Ino is great.</i>

608
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,831
<i>She knows everything,
is stylish, and is cute.</i>

609
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,684
<i>And her skill with shuriken...</i>

610
00:46:36,356 --> 00:46:37,899
<i>Even her ninjutsu is great.</i>

611
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,673
<i>Compared to her, I...</i>

612
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,303
Sakura?

613
00:46:48,581 --> 00:46:50,875
If you're a cosmos flower...

614
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:54,361
then am I a thoroughwort?

615
00:46:56,788 --> 00:46:58,373
What are you saying?!

616
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,510
What?

617
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:01,925
Let me see...

618
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:07,181
You're not a flower yet,
you're still just a bud!

619
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,120
You're right.

620
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,071
Say, Ino...

621
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,335
Why... did you give this ribbon to me?

622
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:30,051
I thought it'd be a waste for
you to wilt away as a bud.

623
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:39,090
A flower is meaningless until it blooms.

624
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,083
<i>Thank you...</i>

625
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,294
<i>Ino!</i>

626
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,631
<i>Ino...</i>

627
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:14,224
<i>I've always believed in what
you told me back then.</i>

628
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,436
<i>I really hoped it could be true.</i>

629
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,273
<i>That I could become
a beautiful flower...</i>

630
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:28,780
<i>I always looked up to you
because I wanted to be just like you.</i>

631
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,953
<i>Thanks to that, I'm here now.</i>

632
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,333
<i>So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.</i>

633
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:06,983
W-What's with Sakura?

634
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:08,587
Hmm.

635
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,305
Why are those two getting so worked up?!

636
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:19,804
<i>Honestly, he doesn’t realize why
he’s always challenging Sasuke.</i>

637
00:49:20,398 --> 00:49:25,069
Well, rivals are mysterious things.

638
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:26,305
Huh?

639
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:29,767
Oh, hi...

640
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:34,075
<i>My rival from youth, Kakashi...</i>

641
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:39,351
<i>Oh, how that nonchalant attitude of his
is so infuriatingly cool!</i>

642
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,796
I understand... Sakura.

643
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,044
- This time for sure...
- This time for sure...

644
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,880
- with full strength...
- with full strength...

645
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,131
- a fair... fight!
- a fair... fight!

646
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,970
<i>Just a Clone Jutsu?!</i>

647
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,223
This isn't a ninja Academy's
graduation exam!

648
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,475
You think you can beat me...

649
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,335
with a basic ninja art?!

650
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:27,617
If you still think
I'm the same old crybaby Sakura,

651
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,109
you've got another thing coming!

652
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,789
<i>However, her opponent is good too.</i>

653
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,667
<i>This evenly matched battle looks
like it's going to take a while!</i>

654
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:57,891
<i>Since when did she get this strong?!</i>

655
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,808
<i>I can make it, too!</i>

656
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,394
<i>You little!</i>

657
00:51:07,553 --> 00:51:08,638
Whoa!

658
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,609
<i>This is long...</i>

659
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,270
<i>They've been going at it
for ten minutes, at the least.</i>

660
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,158
You shouldn't be evenly
matched with me!

661
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,619
What makes you think
I'm evenly matched with you...

662
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:26,683
who only cares about her looks
and her precious long hair?!

663
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,796
You!

664
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,960
You take that back!

665
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,508
Idiot.

666
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:37,424
She's going for the bait.

667
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,014
Who knows what Ino will do!

668
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,017
I don't like Ino when she's that way!

669
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,822
You're simple-minded...

670
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,865
<i>Uh oh.</i>

671
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:01,071
<i>She's totally lost it!</i>

672
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,746
<i>- This is!
- This is!</i>

673
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,918
<i>- This is...
- This is...</i>

674
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,210
<i>- the end!
- the end!</i>

675
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,412
Both parties are unable
to continue the match!

676
00:52:46,215 --> 00:52:47,759
By double knockout,

677
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,334
no one advances from
the fourth preliminary match!

678
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,460
- What?!
- Huh?!

679
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:57,984
Now then...

680
00:52:58,603 --> 00:52:59,687
Good grief.

681
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,221
Hey, Ino!

682
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:04,375
Sakura!

683
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,610
Sakura!

684
00:53:05,804 --> 00:53:07,972
A-Are you okay?!

685
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,825
<i>Seeing that made me all fired up, too!</i>

686
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,268
Now...

687
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,506
The second one from the Sand...

688
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,425
- This should be an interesting match.
- Do your best, Tenten!

689
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,670
The fifth battle...

690
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,966
Tenten, Temari...
come forward!

691
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:50,791
It looks like you finally
woke up, huh... Sakura.

692
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,146
Huh?!

693
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,274
Tenten, power of youth!

694
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,484
Go, Go!

695
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,778
There is no limit to your youth!

696
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,448
Our match is already over.

697
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,745
To think I tied with somebody like you...

698
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,203
Huh?

699
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,580
Here!

700
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,753
Your own flower bloomed, didn't it?

701
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,880
A beautiful flower!

702
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,804
Ino...

703
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,648
However...

704
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:39,924
the next time we fight,

705
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,028
it won't end with you
getting knocked out!

706
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,612
Hm?!

707
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:48,439
And... I won't hand over
Sasuke to you!

708
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:53,456
Right back at you!

709
00:54:56,017 --> 00:54:57,017
- Humph!
- Humph!

710
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,998
T-That's awful.

711
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,964
Tenten!

712
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:06,343
How boring... really.

713
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,308
Temari wins the fifth battle.

714
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
Oh no!

715
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,320
Nice catch.

716
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,569
What are you doing?!

717
00:55:26,102 --> 00:55:29,649
Is that how you treat an opponent
who gave it their all?!

718
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,150
You're annoying!

719
00:55:32,402 --> 00:55:34,487
Take that trash away already!

720
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:36,656
Stop! Lee!

721
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,668
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

722
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,377
<i>What?!</i>

723
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,671
You're just like you look...

724
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,756
Stop! Lee!

725
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,674
Guy-sensei!

726
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
Temari.

727
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,847
Come up quick, you've been
declared the winner.

728
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:56,227
Don't waste your time with
that fool and his master.

729
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,103
What?!

730
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,233
You ninja of the Sand...

731
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,238
Allow me to give you a word of warning.

732
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,201
This kid is strong.

733
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,578
You should prepare yourselves.

734
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,542
Picking a fight with the Sand...

735
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,255
I definitely wouldn't want
to fight those guys.

736
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,342
T-They're all terrifying...

737
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,730
Don't lose to those guys!

738
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:36,906
Naruto!

739
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:38,564
S-Sakura.

740
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,976
Sakura... Are you okay?

741
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,527
Never mind that,
you should worry about yourself!

742
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,864
Huh? Me? I'm not injured or anything.

743
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:51,446
That's not what I mean.

744
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,536
If you lose here,
it'll be a disgrace.

745
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,621
You'd be ashamed to face Sasuke!

746
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,415
Y-Yeah.

747
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,085
Okay, hurry, hurry!
Me next!

748
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,826
Next! It's my turn!

749
00:57:10,508 --> 00:57:11,948
Damn!

750
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:13,971
It's me.

751
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,391
That guy manipulates shadows.

752
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,601
Be careful of the shadows...

753
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,940
I won't lose to a stupid jutsu like that.

754
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:26,185
Shikamaru!

755
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,087
Wipe the floor with her!
And while you're at it...

756
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,864
Ugh, what a drag.

757
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,075
Plus, my opponent's a woman...
Makes it even more of a drag.

758
00:57:35,192 --> 00:57:37,194
If that's what you think,
I'll end this quickly.

759
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,955
Go, go! Shikamaru!

760
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,858
<i>Well, you could say that
I know these guys' raw power</i>

761
00:57:41,883 --> 00:57:44,620
<i>from that incident from
the second test...</i>

762
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:47,773
<i>I don't know anything about
this one's jutsu.</i>

763
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,843
<i>On top of that, she's seen my jutsu...</i>

764
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,377
- The sixth battle.
- <i>That being said, for me...</i>

765
00:57:55,668 --> 00:57:56,752
Shikamaru versus Kin!

766
00:57:58,353 --> 00:57:59,212
Begin!

767
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,895
<i>Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

768
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,104
That jutsu!

769
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,025
It's useless as long as I watch
your shadow's movements!

770
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,654
<i>Bells?</i>

771
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,992
Heh, that's a classic.

772
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,078
Next, you'll throw senbons with bells

773
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,873
and senbons without bells
at the same time, right?

774
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,226
You're a chatty guy!

775
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,136
So in order to not get caught
by the shadow senbons...

776
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:29,136
I'm alert to the trick
and look closely...

777
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:31,934
<i>What?!</i>

778
00:58:32,248 --> 00:58:33,248
<i>Behind?!</i>

779
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:37,010
<i>String?</i>

780
00:58:37,398 --> 00:58:38,398
Too late!

781
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:41,074
Shikamaru!

782
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,724
He took that pretty bad.

783
00:58:43,098 --> 00:58:45,392
It wasn't that bad, look closely.

784
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:46,606
M-My body...

785
00:58:49,816 --> 00:58:52,462
Shadow Possession Jutsu, success.

786
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,155
W-What are you saying?

787
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,158
No way!
Your shadow isn't anywhere...

788
00:58:58,212 --> 00:58:59,880
You don't realize it yet?

789
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,996
I-It can't be...

790
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,832
That's exactly it, you idiot!

791
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:09,834
A thread at this height
won't cast a shadow.

792
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,467
I can stretch and shrink
my own shadow.

793
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,921
But... How do you win with that?

794
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,480
I'm just gonna move
the same way as you.

795
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:25,057
What a drag.

796
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,360
No way! You're...

797
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,838
We're gonna throw shuriken
at each other.

798
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,030
How far will we go?

799
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:37,270
Fool, stop it!

800
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,953
<i>You're only talk...</i>

801
00:59:44,229 --> 00:59:45,397
And that's checkmate.

802
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,585
If you're a shinobi,

803
00:59:49,025 --> 00:59:52,028
you have to understand the situation
and the surroundings when you fight.

804
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:54,325
Even though we made
the same movements...

805
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,385
Winner! Shikamaru Nara.

806
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,554
Good job Shikamaru!

807
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,740
Cool!

808
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,932
And the next match.

809
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,810
The people left are that Sound guy,

810
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,272
me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.

811
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,149
And that Sand guy...

812
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,861
Just please don't make me fight that guy.

813
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,699
This year's rookies are pretty impressive...

814
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,710
It's here, it's here, it's here!

815
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,462
What we've been waiting for!

816
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,131
It's finally my turn!

817
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,675
Yeah! Lucky us!

818
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,553
If it's this guy, it's an easy win, Akamaru!

819
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,640
Yahoo!

820
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,076
- If I'm not next, Sakura will be so disappointed.
- I'm gonna do it!

821
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,478
- She'll just think I'm "Bushy Brow".
- I'm gonna go for it!

822
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,731
- If I'm not next... Sakura...
- Just watch me! Yay!

823
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,735
<i>This Lee kid, he's just like
Guy was in the past...</i>

824
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,115
Do your best, Naruto.

825
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,326
Leave it to me.

826
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,080
<i>Well Naruto, show us...</i>

827
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,415
<i>how much you've grown.</i>

828
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,587
I'm going to do it!

829
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:20,635
The seventh battle,
Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.

830
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,847
I got sick of waiting!

831
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,559
It's finally time for me to shine!

832
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,562
That's my line!

833
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,690
With you as my opponent,
victory is in the bag!

834
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:34,815
Right, Akamaru?

835
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,403
Don't get excited!

836
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,822
You won't be able to beat me!

837
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,365
Why you little...!

838
01:01:44,028 --> 01:01:46,498
Hey! Don't bring your puppy!

839
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,105
He'll get in the way of the match!

840
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:49,340
You fool!

841
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,249
Akamaru's going to fight with me.

842
01:01:52,616 --> 01:01:54,910
Hey, hey! Is that okay?

843
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,148
Yes.

844
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,257
Animals and insects are treated
the same as ninja tools.

845
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,592
There's no problem.

846
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,388
Well, that's fine!

847
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,765
It's a perfect handicap!

848
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,851
Talking tough!

849
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,435
Then...

850
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,397
Akamaru, stay out of this one.

851
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,982
I'll fight him by myself!

852
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:20,115
Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like this!

853
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,822
<i>Naruto, huh?</i>

854
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,576
<i>I'm sorry, but he can't beat Kiba...</i>

855
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,827
<i>Kakashi.</i>

856
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,203
<i>Naruto...</i>

857
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,206
<i>I-I want to support you, but...</i>

858
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,543
<i>Kiba's on my team...</i>

859
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,463
Kiba's lucky.

860
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,713
Hah!

861
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,303
Well then. Please begin!

862
01:02:46,986 --> 01:02:49,572
<i>Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry: All Four Jutsu!</i>

863
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,354
Here I come!

864
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:05,531
It'll be a while
until he opens his eyes, Proctor.

865
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,241
Just as I thought.

866
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:10,493
That Naruto is no match for Kiba.

867
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,787
Naruto...

868
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,664
That was too embarrassing to watch.

869
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,876
See...

870
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,546
What was that?
That guy is weak.

871
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,633
Don't...

872
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,177
Don't...

873
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,138
underestimate me!

874
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,602
Yeah!

875
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,688
<i>He seems to have grown,
to say things like that.</i>

876
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,982
What are you talking about,
bleeding like that?

877
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,235
Your tough talk has gone too far!

878
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:47,323
I didn't use my full power...
I wanted to observe your strength first!

879
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,829
You too, cut out the tough talk
and use the dog or whatever you want!

880
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,665
You'll regret this...

881
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,084
Let's go Akamaru!

882
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,257
Smoke bomb?

883
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,466
Take this!

884
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,316
<i>I can't see!</i>

885
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,484
<i>This is bad!</i>

886
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,572
<i>I have to get out of the smoke...
or I'll be done for.</i>

887
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,751
Yeah! We did it!

888
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,297
Yay! Good job, Akama-

889
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,135
A-Akamaru...

890
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,760
Why?

891
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,599
Y-You!

892
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Transformation Jutsu?!

893
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,476
Ouch! Shoot!

894
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,019
Let go!

895
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,773
You smell like a dog!

896
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,401
W-Where's Akamaru?!

897
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,776
Over here!

898
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,489
Akamaru! Damn!

899
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,493
Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu to
a Transformation Jutsu, that's a clever trick.

900
01:05:14,985 --> 01:05:16,987
Naruto shouldn't be able to do that...

901
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,541
His timing with his jutsu is very good.

902
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,419
What? He's better than I thought.

903
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,922
N-Naruto... you're amazing!

904
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,798
That's amazing, Naruto!

905
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,678
You got a little bit stronger.

906
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,889
But it's over.

907
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,974
Next, I'll attack you seriously.

908
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,768
Oh really?!

909
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:42,624
But you will absolutely not beat me!

910
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,245
W-What's this?!

911
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:02,109
What did you feed him?
His fur turned red!

912
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,002
That's why "Aka" is in his name—
it means red.

913
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,838
<i>Soldier pills huh...?</i>

914
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,966
<i>That Kiba...</i>

915
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,385
<i>He intends to end it with this.</i>

916
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,053
Here we go, Akamaru!

917
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,765
<i>Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:</i>

918
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,686
<i>Man Beast Clone!</i>

919
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,067
T-There's something wrong
with their eyes!

920
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,986
He's using some weird pills.

921
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,946
Isn't this doping?

922
01:06:32,064 --> 01:06:33,064
Is this okay?!

923
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,575
Yes. Food pills are considered a
type of ninja tool.

924
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,745
Is that all you ever say?!

925
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,162
Let's go!

926
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:56,636
<i>This isn't good...</i>

927
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,164
<i>There's no way to counterattack...</i>

928
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,725
<i>All I can do is gather all
the chakra in my legs</i>

929
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,393
<i>and do my best to escape...!</i>

930
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,727
<i>At this rate...</i>

931
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:09,900
Take this!

932
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,736
<i>Man Beast Taijutsu Technique:</i>

933
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,658
<i>Fang Over Fang</i>

934
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,130
This is the difference in
our true powers.

935
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,679
I'm going...

936
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,265
to become the Hokage...

937
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,935
I can't lose here!

938
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,521
You? Hokage?!

939
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,315
When you're weaker than me?

940
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:55,071
I'll become Hokage... in your place!

941
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,742
<i>Transform!</i>

942
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,874
<i>Hey, hey, are you serious?</i>

943
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,143
<i>You've been here three years</i>

944
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,207
<i>and you can't even do
a proper Transformation?!</i>

945
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,005
<i>All of you watch now!</i>

946
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:17,678
<i>I will definitely, someday,
become a true Hokage!</i>

947
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,225
<i>Lame! Him, Hokage?!</i>

948
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:30,564
You know deep down inside that
you can't become the Hokage.

949
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,608
So quit acting tough!

950
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,444
<i>You're wrong Kiba...</i>

951
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:48,165
I'll just make it so
you won't stand up again!

952
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,791
Let's go, Akamaru!

953
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,866
You think you can get me with
that same technique again?!

954
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,391
<i>Damn!</i>

955
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:13,815
<i>Damn!</i>

956
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,152
I have to counterattack somehow.

957
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:22,700
<i>Even if I do, it has to get Kiba
or there's no point!</i>

958
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,828
<i>But which is which...?</i>

959
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,413
<i>T-That's it!</i>

960
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,625
<i>Transform!</i>

961
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,214
I see how it is...

962
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,724
I see, so that's your move...

963
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,308
But...

964
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,103
But the Transformation Jutsu
is useless now!

965
01:09:52,763 --> 01:09:54,681
Why, you ask?

966
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,066
Yeah!

967
01:09:58,047 --> 01:09:59,506
I can smell you.

968
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:04,017
Don't mess with our
sense of smell, Naruto.

969
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:10,164
<i>Damn! What in the world is going on...?!</i>

970
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,293
So you're the real Naruto!

971
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,753
Messing with me!

972
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,797
<i>What?!</i>

973
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,179
He did it!

974
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,562
You little...!

975
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,524
Think hard about your jutsu
before you use them!

976
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:41,528
Because they'll be used
against you, stupid!

977
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:47,034
<i>He's using my line, word for word...</i>

978
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,621
<i>Arguing with this guy is only
a waste of time!</i>

979
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,706
<i>Don't go at Naruto's pace...</i>

980
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,415
<i>Calm down.</i>

981
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,419
<i>Calm down!</i>

982
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:02,716
<i>He can't actually keep up with
my movements yet...</i>

983
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,719
<i>I still have the advantage!</i>

984
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,392
<i>Look closely at Naruto's movements
and if there's an opening...</i>

985
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,770
<i>I can definitely get him
from behind with the All Fours Jutsu.</i>

986
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,774
So you've finally gotten serious, Kiba?

987
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:22,027
Well then... I'll end this...

988
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,573
with a new special move I've been saving!

989
01:11:26,697 --> 01:11:29,199
What new special move?!

990
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:30,998
That's obviously a bluff!

991
01:11:31,263 --> 01:11:34,641
You can test out whether
it's a bluff or not!

992
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,707
I won't let you!

993
01:11:37,275 --> 01:11:38,275
You're slow!

994
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,046
Take this!

995
01:11:42,744 --> 01:11:43,453
Oops!

996
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,118
<i>Right now, Kiba's sense of smell
is tens of thousands of times</i>

997
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,810
<i>more powerful than normal...</i>

998
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,606
Naruto!

999
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,942
Now's your chance!

1000
01:12:03,514 --> 01:12:05,474
Damn!
I was straining too much...

1001
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:07,269
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1002
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:12,619
Okay! The way you've torn me
apart up until now,

1003
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,079
I'll give it back all at once!

1004
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:18,916
<i>U-!</i>

1005
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,173
<i>Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!</i>

1006
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,265
<i>Naruto Barrage!</i>

1007
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,328
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

1008
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,039
Ohhhh!

1009
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,849
Cha!

1010
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,292
Nice one!

1011
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:01,710
You did it!

1012
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:05,445
That Naruto beat Kiba!

1013
01:13:06,004 --> 01:13:07,673
Never thought he had it in him...

1014
01:13:07,837 --> 01:13:08,837
Yup!

1015
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,719
<i>Yes!</i>

1016
01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:23,731
That was easy!

1017
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,903
<i>W-What to do?</i>

1018
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:29,947
<i>What should I do...?</i>

1019
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,329
N-Naruto...

1020
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:40,864
Huh? Hinata?

1021
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:42,476
Did you say something?

1022
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,337
Ah, ah, ah...
Umm...

1023
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:56,341
Huh?

1024
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:57,682
<i>Hinata...?</i>

1025
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:01,285
What's this?

1026
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,689
It's an ointment.

1027
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:06,028
Why for me?

1028
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,571
Just take it, Naruto.

1029
01:14:12,354 --> 01:14:14,773
Hmmm. Okay!

1030
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:18,041
Thank you! You're nice, Hinata!

1031
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,960
<i>Kiba, it's nothing to be
embarrassed about...</i>

1032
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,213
<i>This kid was a really
strong opponent.</i>

1033
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:48,682
<i>You seem quite carefree, Lady Hinata...</i>

1034
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,407
This medicine works really well!

1035
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,712
Here, Sakura. Do you want to
use some too?

1036
01:15:02,026 --> 01:15:06,344
<i>Only your wounds heal
with such speed... Naruto.</i>

1037
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:11,044
<i>The power of Nine-Tails is
truly something else.</i>

1038
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,439
U-Umm...

1039
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:27,042
T-This is...

1040
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,252
ointment for your wound,

1041
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,526
for you, Kiba, and for Akamaru.

1042
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,463
Rather than worrying about others,

1043
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,489
it's about time you worried
about yourself!

1044
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:37,596
There are only 6 people left...

1045
01:15:37,845 --> 01:15:43,768
you, Choji, Neji, Lee, that Sound guy,
and that Sand guy.

1046
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:46,923
Listen, Hinata...

1047
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,964
If you get matched with that Sand guy,
withdraw immediately.

1048
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,383
And there's one more...

1049
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,639
<i>Hinata...</i>

1050
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,686
<i>This is going to be an interesting match...</i>

1051
01:16:16,162 --> 01:16:19,332
I never thought that I would
have a fight with you...

1052
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:20,783
Lady Hinata.

1053
01:16:21,464 --> 01:16:22,464
Brother Neji...

1054
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:23,908
Brother?

1055
01:16:24,318 --> 01:16:25,277
They're descended from

1056
01:16:25,302 --> 01:16:28,430
one of the most noble clans
in the Hidden Leaf Village...

1057
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,876
The Hyuga Clan.

1058
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,879
But, they're not siblings.

1059
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,465
Then, how are they related?

1060
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:36,882
Yes!

1061
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,515
Hinata is from the Head Family.

1062
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,888
In other words, a person from
the main household.

1063
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,225
And Neji, he's from a Branch Family
that is descended from the main one.

1064
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:48,645
In other words,
it's a fight between relatives.

1065
01:16:49,173 --> 01:16:51,342
It must be uneasy for both of them...

1066
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:53,734
I've heard that from long ago,

1067
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,070
there've been various incidents between
the Head Family and Branch Family,

1068
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:58,765
and now their relationship
isn't on very good terms.

1069
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:02,075
Start the battle please!

1070
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,163
Just one thing before we square off
against each other in the fight...

1071
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:08,293
I should advise you, Lady Hinata.

1072
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:10,499
Withdraw!

1073
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,211
You're not suited to being a shinobi.

1074
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:16,428
You're too nice.

1075
01:17:18,129 --> 01:17:21,286
And, you have no confidence
in yourself.

1076
01:17:22,094 --> 01:17:24,096
You're always feeling inferior...

1077
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,264
You'd rather just stay a Genin,
wouldn't you?

1078
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:31,647
However, you can't register for
the Chunin Exam without three members...

1079
01:17:32,442 --> 01:17:35,570
So you couldn't refuse when Kiba
and the others proposed it,

1080
01:17:35,778 --> 01:17:38,906
the truth is, you entered
the exam reluctantly.

1081
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:40,610
Is that wrong?!

1082
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:42,310
T-That's wrong...

1083
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,616
That's not true...

1084
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,159
I...

1085
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,928
I only...

1086
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,790
I wanted to change that about myself...

1087
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:51,009
So I proposed it myself...

1088
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,002
People can never change!

1089
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:58,057
A failure will always be a failure...

1090
01:17:58,652 --> 01:18:01,488
That personality and strength
won't change.

1091
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:07,406
I've seen everything with
this Byakugan.

1092
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:09,308
That's why I understand!

1093
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,269
You're just talking tough.

1094
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:16,191
You're really thinking that you'd
like to run away from this place...

1095
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:18,527
T-That's wrong...

1096
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,070
I really...

1097
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,612
Byakugan?

1098
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:26,410
The Byakugan is one of the
Hyuga clan's Kekkei Genkai,

1099
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,787
a visual jutsu similar to the Sharingan...

1100
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,710
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1101
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:50,600
Just now from my pressure,

1102
01:18:50,912 --> 01:18:55,292
your line of sight was pushed
to the upper left.

1103
01:18:56,773 --> 01:19:00,026
This is the sign that you're recalling
your past experience...

1104
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,112
your bitter past.

1105
01:19:03,104 --> 01:19:06,649
And soon after that, your line of sight
moved to the bottom right...

1106
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:12,789
This is the sign that you're imagining
physical and mental suffering.

1107
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:14,571
That means...

1108
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,085
you're picturing your old self,

1109
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,188
and from all of your experiences
up until now,

1110
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,423
you're imagining the result
of this battle...

1111
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,010
The image of you losing!

1112
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:31,057
Even the act of propping your arms
in front of your body...

1113
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,935
It's a gesture that means

1114
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:37,370
you want to build a wall
between us and keep distant.

1115
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:39,982
Furthermore...

1116
01:19:40,768 --> 01:19:42,569
Laying a finger on your lips,

1117
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:45,989
that's also a self-soothing gesture
that reveals your panic.

1118
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,331
It represents a defense instinct

1119
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,739
you want to alleviate the tension
and unease.

1120
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:57,688
Changing yourself is something
you absolutely can't-

1121
01:19:57,713 --> 01:19:58,713
Sure, she can!

1122
01:20:01,926 --> 01:20:04,726
You don't get to decide that for her,
you idiot!

1123
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:07,219
Give it to him, Hinata!

1124
01:20:08,751 --> 01:20:10,753
Don't just take it!
Argue back!

1125
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,850
I'm getting irritated watching this!

1126
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,896
<i>What an annoying guy!</i>

1127
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:25,986
<i>Naruto...</i>

1128
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,824
<i>Thank you!</i>

1129
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,804
<i>The expression of her eyes
has changed...</i>

1130
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,416
So you're not going to withdraw?

1131
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:40,643
I'm not taking responsibility
for what happens!

1132
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:42,586
<i>I... don't...</i>

1133
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,340
<i>I don't go back on my word...</i>

1134
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,467
<i>That's my Ninja Way!</i>

1135
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,011
<i>I don't want to run anymore!</i>

1136
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,054
<i>Byakugan!</i>

1137
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,115
Fine...

1138
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,413
The man who is most likely

1139
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:19,650
the strongest Genin in the Leaf
is on my team.

1140
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,458
That's...

1141
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,420
That guy, Neji Hyuga.

1142
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,170
Did it go in?!

1143
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,072
No... it was shallow!

1144
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,159
No. Even a graze works

1145
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,620
That's the reason that the Hyuga clan

1146
01:21:56,869 --> 01:21:59,205
is called the Hidden Leaf's
distinguished family.

1147
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,166
Huh? What do you mean?

1148
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:06,087
The Hyuga has a unique taijutsu style
passed down for generations.

1149
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,400
It's not like the kind of taijutsu that
Lee and I are good at...

1150
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,903
Our fighting style, the Strong Fist (Gōken),

1151
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:16,933
is mainly to inflict external damage
on our enemy,

1152
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,960
like broken bones and surface wounds.

1153
01:22:19,597 --> 01:22:22,141
In contrast, the Hyuga's taijutsu
inflict damage

1154
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,624
on the chakra network through
which chakra flows through the body,

1155
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:28,568
and damaging the insides. In other words,
it destroys internal organs.

1156
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,946
They possess the Gentle Fist (Jūken).

1157
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,782
It's not spectacular to watch...

1158
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,159
but later it slowly takes effect.

1159
01:22:37,298 --> 01:22:38,298
Sensei...

1160
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,664
But, how can they do that?

1161
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,751
After all, the chakra network
isn't visible to the eyes.

1162
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,546
How do they attack the chakra
lines inside the body?

1163
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,297
No.

1164
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,092
The eyes of those two...

1165
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,720
They can see it with
their Byakugan.

1166
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:05,021
And a Gentle Fist attack is a little
different from a regular attack.

1167
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,608
They release their own chakra

1168
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:13,363
from a chakra points in their hands
and inject it into their opponent's body.

1169
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,153
It directly inflicts damage on
your enemy's chakra network.

1170
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,327
All right!

1171
01:23:25,122 --> 01:23:26,762
As I thought, this is the extent of...

1172
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,795
the Head Family's power!

1173
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:31,122
What the?!

1174
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:34,217
But Hinata landed a perfect strike!

1175
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,259
<i>N-Not yet...</i>

1176
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:40,942
<i>What's with this guy...!</i>

1177
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:49,733
Y-You mean... All this time...?

1178
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:53,528
That's right. I can see all
your tenketsu.

1179
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,655
W-What is he talking about?!

1180
01:23:56,029 --> 01:23:57,405
On the chakra network...

1181
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:00,730
there are 361 pressure points,
also known as chakra points,

1182
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:02,590
each about the size of a pinhead.

1183
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:03,989
They are the tenketsu.

1184
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:11,838
Theoretically, hitting one directly
can halt or increase chakra flow,

1185
01:24:12,377 --> 01:24:15,755
enabling one to gain complete control
over an opponent's flow of chakra.

1186
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,720
Just so you know,

1187
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,527
not even my Sharingan
can see the chakra points!

1188
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,562
Having the penetrating eye
is one thing,

1189
01:24:27,892 --> 01:24:29,828
but to hit it so accurately like
that during a match,

1190
01:24:29,853 --> 01:24:30,853
well, that's just...

1191
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,154
Lady Hinata...

1192
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,991
What we have here is an unchangeable
difference in abilities.

1193
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:44,025
It is a cruel, unchangeable fact.

1194
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,502
You were destined to regret saying

1195
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:50,051
that you don't want to run away,
from the moment you said it.

1196
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,045
Withdraw!

1197
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:55,998
I-I...

1198
01:24:58,747 --> 01:25:00,415
am... sticking by...

1199
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,225
every word...

1200
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,268
I said!

1201
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,897
<i>I'm not gonna run away!</i>

1202
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:16,569
Because that's... my Ninja Way!

1203
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:23,576
I had no idea... Hinata was this tough.

1204
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,036
She's a lot like you.

1205
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:29,666
Come to think of it...
She's always watching you.

1206
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:30,958
Huh?

1207
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,255
<i>Hinata...</i>

1208
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,646
<i>She has reached her limit.</i>

1209
01:25:48,848 --> 01:25:50,975
<i>One more blow and...</i>

1210
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:55,030
Go, Hinata!

1211
01:25:58,811 --> 01:25:59,811
<i>Naruto...</i>

1212
01:26:01,249 --> 01:26:03,210
<i>Strength is back in her eyes...</i>

1213
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,953
<i>I've been watching you...</i>

1214
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:15,378
<i>I've been watching you closely
for many years now!</i>

1215
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:21,329
<i>Why I wonder...?</i>

1216
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,766
<i>I can feel courage welling up.</i>

1217
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:34,606
<i>I feel that I can hang on,
that I can do it...</i>

1218
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,485
<i>that I too am worth something!</i>

1219
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:43,448
Oh!

1220
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:44,210
No!

1221
01:26:44,234 --> 01:26:44,904
Hinata!

1222
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,205
<i>Hinata...</i>

1223
01:26:52,745 --> 01:26:55,198
<i>At some point, Hinata, who was
in the habit of just giving up,</i>

1224
01:26:55,223 --> 01:26:57,308
<i>made up her mind to change.</i>

1225
01:26:58,099 --> 01:26:59,308
<i>I have never...</i>

1226
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:02,550
<i>seen... that look in her eyes before.</i>

1227
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,510
<i>Naruto.</i>

1228
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:09,265
<i>Up until now,
I've always been the one watching,</i>

1229
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,352
<i>but now...</i>

1230
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:14,896
<i>finally, I am...</i>

1231
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:31,463
Your strikes were ineffective
from the very first.

1232
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:34,751
It's the end.

1233
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,423
<i>Hinata... That's enough.</i>

1234
01:27:43,245 --> 01:27:44,455
<i>You lost the match,</i>

1235
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:46,517
<i>but you've changed in the process.</i>

1236
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:48,647
<i>You did well.</i>

1237
01:27:51,942 --> 01:27:54,236
Neji's final blow went
straight for the heart.

1238
01:27:54,892 --> 01:27:55,810
I feel sorry for her,

1239
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,420
but she won't be standing
again now.

1240
01:28:03,766 --> 01:28:05,994
Since further fighting is impossible
under these conditions...

1241
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:06,968
Don't stop it!

1242
01:28:07,088 --> 01:28:08,464
Don't stop the match, y'know!

1243
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,187
Naruto, stop!

1244
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:11,969
What on earth are you saying, you idiot!

1245
01:28:12,073 --> 01:28:14,867
She's done for.
Can't you see she's unconscious...?

1246
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:16,830
Huh?

1247
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,275
Why do you stand up?

1248
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:40,404
If you continue like this,
you'll really die!

1249
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,455
<i>He's finally...
truly seeing me for the first time.</i>

1250
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:46,744
<i>I will not be caught looking bad...</i>

1251
01:28:49,305 --> 01:28:50,657
<i>In front of...</i>

1252
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:53,413
<i>the person I admire most.</i>

1253
01:28:59,718 --> 01:29:01,845
I-I'm not finished yet!

1254
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,423
Stop the tough act...

1255
01:29:05,062 --> 01:29:07,857
I can tell you're just
barely standing.

1256
01:29:09,707 --> 01:29:11,227
You bear the burden of having been born

1257
01:29:11,252 --> 01:29:13,504
to the Head Family of the Hyuga clan.

1258
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:18,863
You're wrong... Brother Neji.

1259
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:22,746
Because I can tell...

1260
01:29:23,981 --> 01:29:27,735
that you are suffering
much more than I am.

1261
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,036
What?!

1262
01:29:29,485 --> 01:29:31,821
You are the one who is torn up

1263
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:36,621
over the fate of the Head
and Branch Families.

1264
01:29:40,953 --> 01:29:42,997
Neji, the match has been called!

1265
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,892
Neji, get a hold of yourself!

1266
01:29:49,388 --> 01:29:51,309
You promised me

1267
01:29:51,564 --> 01:29:53,816
you wouldn't let this Head Family
business get to you!

1268
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,316
Why are all the other Jonin
butting in?!

1269
01:29:56,814 --> 01:29:58,494
The Head Family always gets
special treatment, is that it?!

1270
01:30:03,406 --> 01:30:04,406
Hinata?!

1271
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:05,140
Hinata!

1272
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,366
Hinata!

1273
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:10,088
Hinata! Are you okay?!

1274
01:30:10,455 --> 01:30:11,455
Hey!

1275
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:15,209
Naruto...

1276
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:17,786
<i>Do you think...</i>

1277
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:25,345
<i>Did I... change, even a little?</i>

1278
01:30:28,097 --> 01:30:30,266
Hey you, failure!

1279
01:30:32,685 --> 01:30:34,854
I have two pieces of advice for you.

1280
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:37,407
First, if you intend to
call yourself a shinobi,

1281
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,308
stop that pathetic cheering.

1282
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:41,861
And the second...

1283
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:45,615
a failure will always be a failure.

1284
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,483
There's no changing that!

1285
01:30:51,073 --> 01:30:52,450
Do you want to see about that?

1286
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:03,548
You!

1287
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,261
Naruto, I understand how you feel.

1288
01:31:07,178 --> 01:31:10,682
But all fighting must be
done officially in a match!

1289
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:16,079
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort...

1290
01:31:17,063 --> 01:31:18,903
That would make for one exciting
final round, wouldn't it?

1291
01:31:19,665 --> 01:31:23,252
Though, I will probably be the one
to fight Neji...

1292
01:31:29,325 --> 01:31:30,785
All right already.

1293
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:38,999
<i>Oh, no! She's gone into
ventricular fibrillation.</i>

1294
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:40,920
<i>Was he trying to kill her?!</i>

1295
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:43,464
The precious little time you have
would be better spent

1296
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:45,893
seeing to her than glaring at me.

1297
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:47,031
Medics!

1298
01:31:47,056 --> 01:31:48,474
Hurry! What's taking so long?!

1299
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,720
S-Sorry.

1300
01:31:51,764 --> 01:31:54,309
Get her on the stretcher.
One, two, three.

1301
01:31:56,019 --> 01:31:58,187
This is serious! She only has about
10 minutes, at most!

1302
01:31:58,469 --> 01:32:00,596
Get her to the emergency room, now!

1303
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:01,906
Out of the way!

1304
01:32:10,327 --> 01:32:11,328
Hinata...

1305
01:32:17,093 --> 01:32:18,636
I promise you.

1306
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:31,302
I will win, no matter what!

1307
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:33,814
Hey, Choji!

1308
01:32:34,231 --> 01:32:35,441
You're in trouble.

1309
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,069
Only the strong ones are left.

1310
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:41,947
I-I don't care!

1311
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,700
I plan to forfeit right away
if that happens...

1312
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:45,951
So that means...

1313
01:32:46,077 --> 01:32:46,494
Huh?

1314
01:32:46,577 --> 01:32:49,372
... then you plan on skipping
all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, huh?

1315
01:32:49,455 --> 01:32:51,720
What? Come on!

1316
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:54,334
Don't worry.

1317
01:32:54,559 --> 01:32:55,811
If things start getting ugly,

1318
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:59,632
I'll step in and stop the fight,
like I did for Hinata. Okay?

1319
01:33:00,216 --> 01:33:01,801
Prime beef tongue, short ribs...

1320
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:04,402
- It'll be...
- <i>Don't motivate him with food!</i>

01:33:04,887 --> 01:33:06,405
<i>Besides, he didn't even...</i>

1322
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,470
- ... all-you-can-eat!
- <i>step in to stop Hinata's fight.</i>

1323
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:17,732
B-B-Q! All right, BBQ! All-you-can-eat!

1324
01:33:22,066 --> 01:33:24,444
I'm curious about that guy, Neji, too...

1325
01:33:26,992 --> 01:33:28,411
I have an idea.

1326
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:31,372
Kankuro?

1327
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:34,125
Just a little information-gathering.

1328
01:33:35,918 --> 01:33:36,419
Hey!

1329
01:33:36,627 --> 01:33:37,627
Huh?

1330
01:33:37,753 --> 01:33:39,714
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

1331
01:33:40,089 --> 01:33:42,383
Shouldn't you be with your friends?

1332
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,010
I-It's none of your business, is it?!

1333
01:33:45,594 --> 01:33:47,471
<i>Hmmm. Well, well...</i>

1334
01:33:47,972 --> 01:33:50,224
That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?

1335
01:33:50,982 --> 01:33:52,855
Well, it seems to me that

1336
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,465
he didn't reveal the true extent
of his power in that last match.

1337
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:56,564
What's his deal?

1338
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:00,651
I'm going to crush him!

1339
01:34:03,195 --> 01:34:06,532
You seem like a fun guy.
I quite like you.

1340
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:11,149
You're boring.
And I don't like you at all!

1341
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,875
<i>I'm going to waste this guy!</i>

1342
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:21,337
We will now resume the battle.

1343
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,090
Okay!

1344
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:30,222
You'll be up this time for sure.
Go for it, Lee!

1345
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:31,891
No!

1346
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,099
- Huh?
- What?

1347
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:38,147
Seeing as I've come this far,
I'd rather be the last!

1348
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,979
Hurry up and get down here...

1349
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:11,764
Safe!

1350
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:17,686
It worked!

1351
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,606
If you say you want to go last, you won't.

1352
01:35:21,232 --> 01:35:23,234
It's an application of the same law:

1353
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,903
If you aim to hit a telephone pole
with a rock, you’ll miss…

1354
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:28,906
But if you throw it to miss,
you’ll hit it dead-on!

1355
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,117
Right! That's my student!

1356
01:35:32,284 --> 01:35:34,745
I absolutely did not
want to go last!

1357
01:35:35,204 --> 01:35:37,456
I fooled them brilliantly!

1358
01:35:38,415 --> 01:35:40,000
<i>Who exactly fell for it?</i>

1359
01:35:40,283 --> 01:35:43,745
Okay, so let me give you
a nice little piece of advice.

1360
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:45,380
Right!

1361
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,510
Probably no one has noticed yet, but...

1362
01:35:50,427 --> 01:35:52,930
That gourd is suspicious!

1363
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:54,598
I see!

1364
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:56,182
Enough with the notes!

1365
01:35:56,559 --> 01:36:00,479
You're not going to have time to
read them during the match, you fool!

1366
01:36:00,813 --> 01:36:01,813
I see!

1367
01:36:03,274 --> 01:36:04,942
<i>He didn't realize that?</i>

1368
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:08,195
<i>Wow, is Lee going to be all right?</i>

1369
01:36:08,404 --> 01:36:12,741
All right!
Go! Lee!

1370
01:36:13,242 --> 01:36:14,785
Yeah!

1371
01:36:23,392 --> 01:36:26,923
I am honored to face an opponent
like you so early on.

1372
01:36:31,847 --> 01:36:33,349
Please don't be in such a hurry.

1373
01:36:38,967 --> 01:36:41,803
Now then... The 9th match...

1374
01:36:42,354 --> 01:36:43,209
Begin!

1375
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,153
<i>Leaf Hurricane!</i>

1376
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:08,714
<i>A sand-manipulation jutsu?</i>

1377
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:10,466
<i>Sounds like trouble.</i>

1378
01:37:11,467 --> 01:37:13,510
<i>But let's give it a go!</i>

1379
01:37:39,036 --> 01:37:41,622
Even that Lee's fast strikes...

1380
01:37:41,747 --> 01:37:43,123
have no effect at all!

1381
01:37:43,499 --> 01:37:45,668
What's the deal, y'know?!

1382
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:49,713
No physical attack will have
any effect on him.

1383
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,422
What?

1384
01:37:50,756 --> 01:37:52,758
The Sand shields and protects Gaara

1385
01:37:53,052 --> 01:37:55,889
independently of his will.

1386
01:37:57,295 --> 01:38:00,966
That's why... no one has been able
to do it so far...

1387
01:38:02,434 --> 01:38:05,771
to injure Gaara...

1388
01:38:06,355 --> 01:38:10,150
<i>Curses! He's not moving
a muscle and still...!</i>

1389
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:12,444
Is that it?

1390
01:38:14,613 --> 01:38:17,241
Entertain me a bit more...

1391
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:20,502
There's not enough...

1392
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,538
Blood!

1393
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:41,473
Why is Lee only using taijutsu?

1394
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:44,018
He'll never be able to get close
enough for that!

1395
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:47,896
Why doesn't he step back a bit and
use ninjutsu or something?

1396
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:50,607
It's not that he doesn't use it.

1397
01:38:51,505 --> 01:38:52,506
He can't use it.

1398
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:53,622
Huh?

1399
01:38:54,182 --> 01:38:58,144
Lee has almost no ninjutsu
or genjutsu skills.

1400
01:38:58,824 --> 01:39:00,034
N-No way!

1401
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:05,205
When I first met Lee,
he was completely inept.

1402
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:07,207
He had no talent whatsoever.

1403
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,461
What? I can't believe that!

1404
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:28,543
Lee, take them off!

1405
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:31,982
B-But Guy-sensei!

1406
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:36,079
You told me I should only take them off
to protect someone very precious!

1407
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:38,030
It's fine!

1408
01:39:38,324 --> 01:39:39,534
I give you permission!

1409
01:39:47,235 --> 01:39:48,236
Weights?

1410
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:50,815
<i>That's such an old-school
training method...</i>

1411
01:39:52,795 --> 01:39:56,090
All right, now I can
move easily!

1412
01:39:56,517 --> 01:39:59,979
<i>Hmph! Does he think
taking off some little weights</i>

1413
01:40:00,302 --> 01:40:02,679
<i>will let him to outmaneuver Gaara's sand...?</i>

1414
01:40:08,934 --> 01:40:10,894
<i>A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.</i>

1415
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:13,197
Go, Lee!

1416
01:40:13,398 --> 01:40:14,399
Right!

1417
01:40:29,507 --> 01:40:30,507
Go!

1418
01:40:31,444 --> 01:40:32,444
<i>Very close!</i>

1419
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,744
Because he can't use
ninjutsu or genjutsu...

1420
01:40:42,426 --> 01:40:45,971
Therefore, he channeled all
of his time,

1421
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:48,326
all of his energy and...

1422
01:40:48,589 --> 01:40:51,091
all of his being into taijutsu.

1423
01:40:52,733 --> 01:40:55,569
Though he can't do any other jutsu...

1424
01:40:56,336 --> 01:40:58,255
He won't lose to anyone...

1425
01:40:59,072 --> 01:41:01,115
He is a taijutsu specialist!

1426
01:41:14,407 --> 01:41:17,243
<i>I can't believe it!
Gaara's been injured!</i>

1427
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:19,458
<i>No way...!</i>

1428
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,583
Bushy Brow is even faster than before!

1429
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:26,713
Was he this strong?!

1430
01:41:27,406 --> 01:41:33,020
Youth itself is... an explosion!

1431
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,296
Right!

1432
01:41:42,934 --> 01:41:43,934
Over here!

1433
01:41:48,648 --> 01:41:49,648
Good!

1434
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:52,043
<i>I got him good!</i>

1435
01:41:52,162 --> 01:41:54,456
I can't even track him
with my eyes!

1436
01:42:05,991 --> 01:42:06,991
Uh oh...

1437
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,970
Uh oh is right!

1438
01:42:09,027 --> 01:42:12,989
That guy with the black circles under
his eyes is taking some serious hits!

1439
01:42:13,163 --> 01:42:15,064
That's not what I meant.

1440
01:42:15,388 --> 01:42:15,861
Huh?

1441
01:42:29,906 --> 01:42:32,159
<i>Sure enough, he was
encased in sand, huh.</i>

1442
01:42:33,173 --> 01:42:35,467
<i>But, it's been a long time since</i>

1443
01:42:35,492 --> 01:42:37,535
<i>I've seen that expression
on Gaara's face.</i>

1444
01:42:38,258 --> 01:42:41,470
<i>So Gaara's other self has
been awakened, huh?</i>

1445
01:42:44,726 --> 01:42:46,286
<i>But what an incredible
defense he has...</i>

1446
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:50,637
<i>no amount of speed is going
to let me get a strike through.</i>

1447
01:42:51,803 --> 01:42:56,469
<i>I'll have to inflict major damage
even through his sand armor.</i>

1448
01:42:58,489 --> 01:42:59,489
<i>The Lotus is the only way!</i>

1449
01:43:00,349 --> 01:43:01,349
<i>Yes.</i>

1450
01:43:15,348 --> 01:43:16,198
<i>Be ready!</i>

1451
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:25,044
<i>A thin sand guard like that
won't be enough</i>

1452
01:43:25,555 --> 01:43:28,933
<i>in the face of Lee's high speed
Lotus slamming down from above.</i>

1453
01:43:30,769 --> 01:43:32,271
Hurry up and bring it on!

1454
01:43:32,852 --> 01:43:34,645
You asked for it!

1455
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:38,662
Not just yet!

1456
01:43:44,811 --> 01:43:46,396
What an amazing series of kicks!

1457
01:43:49,185 --> 01:43:53,106
<i>Even an ordinary Lotus has
a tremendous strain on the body...!</i>

1458
01:43:53,598 --> 01:43:55,183
<i>Lee, let this be the finishing blow!</i>

1459
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:11,161
Take this!

1460
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,873
<i>Primary Lotus!</i>

1461
01:44:27,749 --> 01:44:28,749
I got him...

1462
01:44:29,586 --> 01:44:30,586
good!

1463
01:44:32,263 --> 01:44:33,806
Right on!

1464
01:44:34,054 --> 01:44:35,764
I-It's over!

1465
01:44:36,019 --> 01:44:37,980
W-What? This can't be!

1466
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,024
He did it! Lee's won!

1467
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:44,194
Hey, he isn't dead, is he?

1468
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:51,978
Wha?!

1469
01:44:54,913 --> 01:44:55,913
What?!

1470
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:00,560
When did that...?!

1471
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:01,837
That's impossible!

1472
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:05,215
While you were closing your eyes
in anticipation.

1473
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:06,465
What?

1474
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:45,797
That bowl-cut guy is totally exhausted...

1475
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,592
Gaara is toying with him.

1476
01:46:04,691 --> 01:46:05,514
<i>Lee...</i>

1477
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:10,781
Idiot! There's no way
you'll become a ninja.

1478
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,075
Yes, I can.

1479
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:17,304
There's no way a loser who can't
even use ninjutsu can become a ninja!

1480
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:18,080
Yes, I can!

1481
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:20,999
Whatever, but the fact that a guy like
you without ninjutsu or genjutsu

1482
01:46:21,024 --> 01:46:22,784
and with taijutsu worse than
an average person,

1483
01:46:22,959 --> 01:46:26,338
you have no place in this ninja academy,
it's nonsense!

1484
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,341
Do you know what you're called here?

1485
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,985
Hot-Blooded!

1486
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:33,428
Hot-Blooded!

1487
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:35,263
Hot-Blooded loser-

1488
01:46:36,264 --> 01:46:38,016
Hey, get in line, Lee!

1489
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,226
Hey Lee!

1490
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,523
So that's the hot-blooded loser
everyone's talking about.

1491
01:46:45,164 --> 01:46:47,667
Doesn't he look like
someone we know?

1492
01:46:47,692 --> 01:46:48,329
Huh?

1493
01:46:49,027 --> 01:46:50,862
In particular... his eyebrows.

1494
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:52,367
Hmm...

1495
01:46:53,323 --> 01:46:54,491
<i>Rock Lee...</i>

1496
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:58,078
<i>The loser who can only perform
under average taijutsu...</i>

1497
01:47:05,364 --> 01:47:06,490
<i>But you...</i>

1498
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:09,236
<i>You practiced your less
than average taijutsu...</i>

1499
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,883
<i>You practiced it over and
over again like crazy...</i>

1500
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:15,303
All right, you've all become
Genin as of today,

1501
01:47:16,179 --> 01:47:18,974
so I'd like to know what
it is you're all aiming for!

1502
01:47:20,474 --> 01:47:22,442
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1503
01:47:22,467 --> 01:47:23,467
Tenten.

1504
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:29,734
I want to become a powerful ninja
like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!

1505
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,083
Hmm...

1506
01:47:31,603 --> 01:47:32,770
I...!

1507
01:47:33,738 --> 01:47:36,116
I want to prove that I can become
a splendid ninja

1508
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:39,536
even though I can't use
ninjutsu or genjutsu!

1509
01:47:40,347 --> 01:47:42,265
That is my ultimate goal!

1510
01:47:46,334 --> 01:47:47,627
<i>I know you won't give in, Lee...</i>

1511
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:50,922
<i>You... continued to make effort.</i>

1512
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:57,679
If I can't jump rope 1,200 times,
I'll do 2,000 log kicks!

1513
01:47:58,054 --> 01:48:00,432
1,116... 1,117!

1514
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,601
1,118... 1,119-

1515
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:03,976
<i>Huh?!</i>

1516
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:20,533
Lee!

1517
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:22,287
Are you taking a break already?

1518
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:32,963
Guy-sensei...

1519
01:48:33,715 --> 01:48:34,715
What is it that you want?

1520
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:37,715
If this is about my mistake on
the recent assignment,

1521
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,722
I believe I already apologized.

1522
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:45,435
Lee...
It's true you're different from Neji.

1523
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:50,482
You have no ninjutsu or genjutsu skills,
and you're not a taijutsu genius either...

1524
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:53,275
But Lee...

1525
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:56,363
you have powers that exceed Neji...

1526
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:59,991
you're a genius with hidden potential.

1527
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:03,203
If you're trying to make me feel better,
please stop!

1528
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:04,620
Idiot!

1529
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:06,913
I'm not trying to make you feel better
or anything!

1530
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:08,917
The reason is that you are...

1531
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:13,880
a genius of effort!

1532
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,053
I wonder if...

1533
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:22,347
If that's true...?

1534
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:28,395
I've... I've believed that to be true...

1535
01:49:29,437 --> 01:49:33,316
That if I trained harder than Neji...
2 or 3 times as much...

1536
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,235
that I'd surely become stronger.

1537
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:37,528
But...

1538
01:49:38,328 --> 01:49:40,956
I've recently begun to think that...

1539
01:49:42,693 --> 01:49:44,529
I can't beat a real genius.

1540
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,665
Is effort really rewarded...?

1541
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:50,763
I've wanted to know this and

1542
01:49:50,788 --> 01:49:53,374
so I've challenged Neji again and again,
but it's always been the same result...!

1543
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,756
I'm no match for him at all!

1544
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,376
Even when I'm on a mission...

1545
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,721
My legs still tremble even now...

1546
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:08,560
I think that no matter how hard I try,
I'll never become stronger...

1547
01:50:09,496 --> 01:50:12,457
I'm so afraid, I can barely stand it!

1548
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:17,902
What am I to do...?

1549
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:23,199
There's no point in making the effort
if you don't believe in yourself!

1550
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:31,916
Lee, you're very similar to me.

1551
01:50:32,281 --> 01:50:33,408
Do you mean our eyebrows?

1552
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,545
No, not just our eyebrows...

1553
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:39,758
I was actually a failure once too...

1554
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:41,885
You were, Sensei?

1555
01:50:42,385 --> 01:50:46,723
But now, I can even win against
the genius elite Kakashi,

1556
01:50:48,099 --> 01:50:49,601
because of my efforts...

1557
01:50:50,268 --> 01:50:52,771
"I'd like to prove that I can become
a respectable ninja

1558
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:56,358
even if I can't use ninjutsu
or genjutsu," you said.

1559
01:50:57,025 --> 01:50:59,444
That's your nindo—your ninja way, right?

1560
01:50:59,922 --> 01:51:01,570
That's a fine goal...

1561
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,367
It's a fine goal worth sticking to!

1562
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:13,625
That's why you must believe in
your path and forge straight ahead!

1563
01:51:15,293 --> 01:51:19,422
Become a man so powerful that I can
proudly watch you succeed with a smile!

1564
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,092
Understand, Lee?!

1565
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:23,634
Yes!

1566
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:43,113
<i>Thank you... Guy-sensei...!</i>

1567
01:51:45,068 --> 01:51:47,154
<i>Sensei is smiling and watching me...</i>

1568
01:51:48,382 --> 01:51:51,802
<i>And just because of that,
I can come back stronger!</i>

1569
01:51:52,747 --> 01:51:55,875
<i>Stronger... stronger still!</i>

1570
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,213
Lee's smiling... even though
he's been driven into a corner.

1571
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:01,964
No.

1572
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:04,092
It's his turn to do the driving.

1573
01:52:04,558 --> 01:52:05,558
Huh?

1574
01:52:06,469 --> 01:52:09,180
The Lotus of the Leaf blooms twice.

1575
01:52:09,931 --> 01:52:10,682
No, Guy!

1576
01:52:10,765 --> 01:52:11,765
You haven't?!

1577
01:52:13,309 --> 01:52:15,103
It's exactly as you imagine.

1578
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,272
So that Genin...

1579
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:21,735
that boy can open some of the
Eight Inner Gates to use the Hidden Lotus...

1580
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:23,902
That's right...

1581
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:25,988
This is incredible...

1582
01:52:27,866 --> 01:52:29,284
What exactly is it?

1583
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:32,662
These Eight Inner Gates and
that Hidden Lotus?

1584
01:52:35,248 --> 01:52:36,328
Alright...

1585
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,377
In the chakra network where chakra flows,

1586
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:42,481
there are eight specific points, or gates,
that regulate the flow of chakra,

1587
01:52:42,927 --> 01:52:45,013
starting from the head and located 
sequentially in various parts of the body...

1588
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:49,042
The Gate of Opening, the Gate of Healing,
the Gate of Life, the Gate of Pain,

1589
01:52:49,067 --> 01:52:54,114
the Gate of Limit, the Gate of View,
the Gate of Wonder, and the Gate of Death.

1590
01:52:54,976 --> 01:52:56,728
These are called the Eight Inner Gates.

1591
01:52:58,396 --> 01:52:59,876
These eight gates continually "limit"

1592
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:03,651
the amount of chakra flowing
through the body...

1593
01:53:04,986 --> 01:53:10,575
However, the essence of the Lotus is
to force these gates open.

1594
01:53:11,409 --> 01:53:15,205
and bring out tens of times
the body's normal strength.

1595
01:53:17,415 --> 01:53:18,666
The Primary Lotus...

1596
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,753
opens the first gate,
the Gate of Opening,

1597
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:22,795
No way!

1598
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,758
Even after using just the Primary Lotus,
his body was in shambles.

1599
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,843
So if he uses a technique beyond that...

1600
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,360
That's right.

1601
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:31,233
Huh?

1602
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,681
By opening all the 8 gates,

1603
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:39,552
one can attain power surpassing
even the Hokage, but in exchange...

1604
01:53:40,393 --> 01:53:41,126
one dies.

1605
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,736
I don't intend to question what that
boy means to you,

1606
01:53:47,416 --> 01:53:49,817
or to tell you not to bring
your personal feelings into play...

1607
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:51,199
But there is a limit!

1608
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:53,368
I've misjudged you, Guy!

1609
01:53:54,389 --> 01:53:58,685
What do you know... about that boy?!

1610
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:02,746
That boy has something important

1611
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:05,942
he's willing to protect
even if it costs him his life.

1612
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:14,264
<i>There is no way that I alone can
lose in a place like this!</i>

1613
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:17,308
<i>Guy-sensei... please allow it.</i>

1614
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:19,602
<i>It is now...</i>

1615
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:24,649
<i>He's opened the third gate,
the Gate of Life...</i>

1616
01:54:25,608 --> 01:54:26,669
<i>He's going to make his move!</i>

1617
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,194
No, not yet!

1618
01:54:28,486 --> 01:54:29,486
What?!

1619
01:54:30,917 --> 01:54:31,917
<i>And also,</i>

1620
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:35,285
<i>the fourth gate, the Gate of Pain...
Open!</i>

1621
01:54:47,505 --> 01:54:48,505
<i>He's fast!</i>

1622
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:52,427
Gaara!

1623
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:53,510
Where are they?!

1624
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,221
He's above!

1625
01:55:08,526 --> 01:55:09,527
<i>What...?!</i>

1626
01:55:10,236 --> 01:55:11,905
<i>The Sand Armor is...</i>

1627
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:15,074
You're a stubborn one.

1628
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,244
Since it comes to this...

1629
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:25,001
<i>The muscles have torn...</i>

1630
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:26,961
<i>Is that really Lee...?</i>

1631
01:55:27,712 --> 01:55:28,992
<i>When did he become like this...?</i>

1632
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:34,302
This is the end!

1633
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:37,889
<i>The fifth gate, the Gate of Limit...
Open!</i>

1634
01:55:40,674 --> 01:55:42,342
<i>I can't defend myself...</i>

1635
01:55:42,894 --> 01:55:44,979
<i>Is this the movement of
a human being?!</i>

1636
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:47,606
<i>Neji...</i>

1637
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:51,069
<i>This technique was my ace in
the hole to take you down...</i>

1638
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:53,988
<i>but now, I'll have to use it here!</i>

1639
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,448
Huh?!

1640
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:09,258
<i>The Sand Shield can't keep up!</i>

1641
01:56:09,738 --> 01:56:11,615
<i>Most of the armor has also
been peeled off...</i>

1642
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:13,170
<i>He's done for!</i>

1643
01:56:13,716 --> 01:56:15,551
<i>Hidden Lotus!</i>

1644
01:56:24,602 --> 01:56:27,313
<i>I can't see anything, it's too fast...</i>

1645
01:56:32,932 --> 01:56:34,433
He's done it this time!

1646
01:56:34,813 --> 01:56:35,564
Gaara!

1647
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:37,781
Lee...

1648
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:43,495
Oh!

1649
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,289
What's... that?

1650
01:56:53,026 --> 01:56:55,069
<i>He protects himself...</i>

1651
01:56:56,419 --> 01:56:58,254
<i>using a gourd made of sand?!</i>

1652
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:15,110
<i>No way!</i>

1653
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:16,946
<i>He got hit by the Hidden Lotus</i>

1654
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:20,094
<i>and he's still able to use
a jutsu...!</i>

1655
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:31,252
<i>Sand Burial!</i>

1656
01:57:43,931 --> 01:57:45,016
Die!

1657
01:58:01,824 --> 01:58:02,909
Why...?

1658
01:58:05,152 --> 01:58:08,155
Why... save him?

1659
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:12,085
He's...

1660
01:58:13,961 --> 01:58:17,673
He's my precious student!

1661
01:58:20,718 --> 01:58:24,597
<i>Those words are definitely
not understandable to Gaara...</i>

1662
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:32,271
I quit...

1663
01:58:36,107 --> 01:58:37,107
- Wha...?
- Huh?

1664
01:58:38,008 --> 01:58:39,009
- Huh?
- Huh?

1665
01:58:39,266 --> 01:58:40,266
Wha?!

1666
01:58:52,041 --> 01:58:53,041
That's impossible...

1667
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,515
<i>Having opened the fifth gate...</i>

1668
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:10,353
<i>And his arm and leg are crushed...</i>

1669
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:12,403
<i>There's no way he should
be able to stand...!</i>

1670
01:59:14,772 --> 01:59:15,398
Lee...

1671
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:16,773
It's all right.

1672
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:18,024
It's over!

1673
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:20,319
You're in no condition to stand...!

1674
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:25,699
Lee...

1675
01:59:26,661 --> 01:59:27,912
Y-You...

1676
01:59:30,309 --> 01:59:31,644
You are...

1677
01:59:37,237 --> 01:59:38,321
<i>So he had already...</i>

1678
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:40,840
<i>Lost consciousness...</i>

1679
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:49,932
You are a splendid ninja...!

1680
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:55,611
The winner...

1681
01:59:55,938 --> 01:59:56,938
Gaara.

1682
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:11,787
<i>Naruto...</i>

1683
02:00:19,444 --> 02:00:22,739
<i>Bushy Brow lost
to a guy like this...!</i>

1684
02:00:25,588 --> 02:00:27,381
Medics, please hurry.

1685
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,194
You are the Jonin in charge of him,
aren't you?

1686
02:00:44,190 --> 02:00:45,774
Y-Yes.

1687
02:00:46,729 --> 02:00:48,064
Please come with me
for a minute.

1688
02:00:53,934 --> 02:00:54,998
Careful...

1689
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:56,873
Don't shake him.

1690
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:04,198
There is faint breathing...

1691
02:01:04,713 --> 02:01:08,008
but due to the comminuted fractures
and muscle tears throughout his body,

1692
02:01:08,469 --> 02:01:12,056
recovery will likely take
a considerable amount of time...

1693
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:15,226
If that was all,
it wouldn't be so bad, but...

1694
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:19,375
The damage to the left arm and leg
which received the attack is severe...

1695
02:01:20,499 --> 02:01:21,320
It's too severe...

1696
02:01:21,511 --> 02:01:24,097
I don't want to say this,

1697
02:01:24,777 --> 02:01:29,282
but he will likely never...
be able to fight as a shinobi again.

1698
02:01:40,935 --> 02:01:41,935
Lee...

1699
02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:47,508
I didn't want to think... that you'd lose.

1700
02:01:48,175 --> 02:01:50,803
Please forgive me for not...

1701
02:01:52,596 --> 02:01:53,806
stopping it...!

1702
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:56,683
Lee...

1703
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:01,602
It's not true... it's not true.

1704
02:02:02,612 --> 02:02:06,992
After hearing that, what's
Bushy Brow supposed to do now...?!

1705
02:02:08,362 --> 02:02:09,362
This guy...

1706
02:02:09,697 --> 02:02:13,826
He said the failure would take
down a genius with effort!

1707
02:02:14,949 --> 02:02:16,242
Calm down, Naruto.

1708
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:20,166
B-But... Kakashi-sensei!

1709
02:02:20,249 --> 02:02:24,462
He kept saying he wanted
to fight Sasuke and Neji!

1710
02:02:24,487 --> 02:02:27,615
Perhaps... that very desire led to his downfall.

1711
02:02:28,758 --> 02:02:30,009
That boy...

1712
02:02:30,426 --> 02:02:31,761
Sasuke and Neji...

1713
02:02:32,134 --> 02:02:33,302
and you...

1714
02:02:34,388 --> 02:02:37,433
he was driven by an unspoken promise.

1715
02:02:38,893 --> 02:02:40,394
He risked his life...

1716
02:02:41,136 --> 02:02:43,972
so that he might have
a chance to battle you guys...

1717
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:51,862
Don't forget that...

1718
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:55,217
<i>Heaven does not permit it.</i>

1719
02:02:55,242 --> 02:02:57,953
<i>One who tries to move ahead
while achieving victory</i>

1720
02:02:58,337 --> 02:03:02,466
<i>through methods that invite mutual destruction.</i>

1721
02:03:08,756 --> 02:03:11,967
<i>So, it ended without incident...</i>

1722
02:03:12,927 --> 02:03:14,553
Welcome back Gaara.

1723
02:03:23,889 --> 02:03:24,889
Guy...

1724
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:26,148
Well...

1725
02:03:26,272 --> 02:03:28,190
I may have spoken harshly earlier, but...

1726
02:03:29,443 --> 02:03:33,197
I've thought about it and
had I been in your position...

1727
02:03:34,573 --> 02:03:38,119
I probably... wouldn't have
been able to stop him either.

1728
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,250
Guy.

1729
02:03:45,508 --> 02:03:48,803
We're in the way of the
next match... let's head up.

1730
02:03:52,736 --> 02:03:53,592
All right...

1731
02:03:57,584 --> 02:04:01,963
Then, for the tenth and final round,
will both contestants please come forward!

1732
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:06,939
<i>So it's finally my turn...</i>

1733
02:04:11,068 --> 02:04:14,113
<i>I'm gonna win and have
some barbecued beef!</i>

1734
02:04:15,156 --> 02:04:19,452
<i>Either way, I need to make it
to the main tournament and fight Sasuke.</i>

1735
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:25,249
<i>Or I will not have met your expectations,
Lord Orochimaru...</i>

1736
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:28,627
<i>I can almost see through it...</i>

1737
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:32,668
<i>The reason that you went to the trouble
of getting to Sasuke before us and...</i>

1738
02:04:33,048 --> 02:04:35,885
<i>putting a Curse Mark on him
without killing him...</i>

1739
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:38,137
<i>In other words,</i>

1740
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:42,975
<i>we were just guinea pigs to measure
Sasuke's abilities during these tests.</i>

1741
02:04:43,749 --> 02:04:48,421
<i>What you wanted isn't Sasuke's life,
but Sasuke himself...</i>

1742
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:52,818
<i>I was also taken for a fool...</i>

1743
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:58,782
Now, let the tenth round begin.

1744
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,576
Do your best!

1745
02:05:00,951 --> 02:05:01,951
Fatso!

1746
02:05:04,371 --> 02:05:05,347
Damn it!

1747
02:05:05,372 --> 02:05:06,916
Those two better watch out!

1748
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:11,587
I'll end this match quickly and
turn you into mincemeat!

1749
02:05:12,377 --> 02:05:14,128
Then let's not play around...

1750
02:05:14,153 --> 02:05:17,198
I'll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.

1751
02:05:18,677 --> 02:05:21,680
You bandaged mummy!

1752
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:23,641
<i>Ninja Art:</i>

1753
02:05:23,666 --> 02:05:24,959
<i>Ninja Art: Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1754
02:05:26,143 --> 02:05:28,312
Followed by the
Hidden Leaf-style taijutsu!

1755
02:05:32,332 --> 02:05:34,668
All I have to do is to prevent him
from aiming at my ears!

1756
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:36,570
<i>Human Boulder!</i>

1757
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:39,907
Yeah! Take that, Human Boulder style!

1758
02:05:45,412 --> 02:05:47,831
<i>The way you are...
you can barely move, can you?</i>

1759
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:49,833
<i>That's where I attack!</i>

1760
02:05:50,751 --> 02:05:52,920
It's no use, I'm wearing ear plugs.

1761
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,225
<i>No, this is the end!</i>

1762
02:05:56,924 --> 02:05:57,924
Oh?!

1763
02:06:05,849 --> 02:06:12,231
<i>The human body is made up of 70% water,
and water is able to transmit sound waves.</i>

1764
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:17,903
<i>In other words, your whole body is like
one big ear.</i>

1765
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:23,464
And the winner is, Dosu Kinuta!

1766
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:30,670
<i>Lord Orochimaru... no, Orochimaru!</i>

1767
02:06:31,239 --> 02:06:36,286
<i>I'll show you...
I'm more than just a guinea pig.</i>

1768
02:06:37,237 --> 02:06:38,571
Are you all right?

1769
02:06:38,882 --> 02:06:40,801
I-I want some BBQ meat...

1770
02:06:41,093 --> 02:06:43,721
Oh man...
And the guy went easy on him, too.

1771
02:06:44,638 --> 02:06:48,392
Even though he lost, the least we can do
is take him for that BBQ.

1772
02:06:50,269 --> 02:06:52,646
It's finally over.

1773
02:06:53,459 --> 02:06:55,961
<i>At long last, the Final Round...</i>

1774
02:06:56,942 --> 02:07:01,657
With that, the preliminaries for
the third test are complete.
