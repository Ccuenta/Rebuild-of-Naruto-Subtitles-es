1
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,039
Hey... don't you want to see it?

2
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,953
It's time.

3
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,079
What?

4
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,248
You know what I'm talking about.

5
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:49,952
Kakashi-sensei's... real face!

6
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,546
What are you doing?!

7
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:54,756
How ridiculous.

8
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,425
I'm not interested.

9
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,362
Today's mission is over.
I'm going home.

10
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,263
Yeah, I agree...

11
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,183
<i>Heh... This sounds kind of fun!</i>

12
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,520
Maybe he has...

13
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,231
Blubbery lips?

14
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:14,169
<i>Blubbery lips... Blubbery lips...</i>

15
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:17,197
<i>Blubbery lips... Blubbery lips...</i>

16
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,755
<i>Just a little more!</i>

17
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:32,753
Or maybe buckteeth?!

18
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:34,378
<i>Buckteeth?!</i>

19
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:38,194
<i>Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?!
Buckteeth?!</i>

20
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:48,621
Now, this is rare...

21
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,506
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!

22
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:54,264
All three of you treating me...

23
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,302
Maybe it'll snow today.

24
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,783
- Great success!
- Great success!

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Know what I mean?

26
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,327
Here! Thanks for waiting!

27
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,865
All three of you treating me...

28
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,559
Maybe it'll snow today.

29
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:13,825
Or if it's not that...

30
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,456
- Great success!
- Great success!

31
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,907
Maybe it's that...

32
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:22,799
Here! Thanks for waiting!

33
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,611
All three of you treating me...

34
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,160
Maybe it'll snow today.

35
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:31,833
Or if it's not that...

36
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:35,217
Are you guys up to something?

37
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,454
- Great success!
- Great success!

38
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,660
... like that.

39
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:50,442
Or if it's not that...
are you guys up to something?

40
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,298
Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!

41
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,201
K-Kakashi-sensei, this is a celebration
for you getting out of the hospital!

42
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:02,301
N-Now! P-P-Please, eat up!

43
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:06,804
All right...
Then I'll dig right in.

44
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,240
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,767
The pork slices are our treat.

46
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:21,998
Thanks for the treat.

47
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:28,225
Oh! Sasuke...
What a coincidence!

48
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,459
Get out of the way, Ino-Pig!

49
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:31,485
What?!

50
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,775
Aw, man! I can't see a thing!

51
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:37,501
I'm finished! That was good...

52
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:38,717
- So fast!
- So fast!

53
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,795
Huh? Something wrong?

54
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,710
N-Nothing's wrong!

55
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,767
Hey!

56
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:46,429
- Huh?
- Huh?

57
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,230
- Wow! I'm really curious!
- Wow! I'm really curious!

58
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:57,666
What?! Another lost cat cat mission?!

59
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:02,025
Not exactly.
This is a Nekomata.

60
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:06,724
Our mission is to get
the paw print of this Nekomata.

61
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:16,976
Nekomata, or whatever!

62
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,542
Let someone else handle
missions like this!

63
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:25,816
Right, Sasuke? Aren't you tired
of missions like this?

64
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,371
Speak up and tell him.

65
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:31,605
Sasuke?

66
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,929
If you don't like it, don't come.

67
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:38,465
This is an Uchiha...
No, it's my mission.

68
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,929
Why?!

69
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:45,381
I'm glad you came, Sasuke.

70
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,589
It's been a while, Granny Cat.

71
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,284
My, how you've grown.

72
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,202
You know her, Sasuke?

73
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:55,726
What is this place anyway?

74
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:04,128
This is the shop where
the Uchiha clan buys weapons.

75
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:07,342
Granny Cat is an important
informant for the Uchiha.

76
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,410
She is also our client
for this mission.

77
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:10,809
Tamaki...

78
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,491
Bring me the Paw Encyclopedia.

79
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,213
Here you are, Granny Cat.

80
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:23,866
You made a whole book out of them?!

81
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,402
Sasuke...

82
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:28,781
You seem to know a lot
about this mission.

83
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,658
Care to explain why?

84
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:38,570
This book started out as a game
between Sasuke and his older brother, Itachi.

85
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,514
Don't talk about him!

86
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm going to start preparations
for the mission.

87
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,113
What's with him?

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,739
They used to be so close.

89
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:04,028
Itachi often came by on errands
with little Sasuke in tow.

90
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,817
But Sasuke would get bored,
throw tantrums,

91
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:12,032
and give Itachi such a hard time.

92
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,993
So Itachi came up with the game

93
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,559
of gathering the paw prints
of quick and nimble cats.

94
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,934
So, it was just a kid's game.

95
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,126
Well yes.

96
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:29,283
But even before he entered the Academy,
he had the skills of a Genin.

97
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:32,144
He was an Uchiha after all.

98
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,877
Anyway,

99
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,597
it was a cute game at first.

100
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,558
But things began to escalate.

101
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:48,277
Sasuke completed nearly all the tasks
that Itachi half-jokingly assigned him.

102
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:53,815
And his collection of paw prints
became this book.

103
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:58,777
But even after Sasuke stopped,
it's been bothering me.

104
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:02,501
As for one of two remaining tasks
that Itachi assigned,

105
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:07,753
I asked Yugito Nii of the Hidden Cloud,
and she was kind enough to agree.

106
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:10,674
<i>Nii of the Hidden Cloud?
Who's that?</i>

107
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:14,956
And so, you're asking us to
get the last one?

108
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:17,512
However...

109
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,316
Nekomata is the boss of
the ninja cat underworld.

110
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:24,177
And he never shows his face in public.

111
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,343
He hides in an impregnable fortress.

112
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,286
The number of ninja cats
who guard Nekomata is unknown.

113
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:36,684
Can a three-man cell
of Genin handle it?

114
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:42,013
Just leave it to us!
Right, Sakura?

115
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:45,723
Even Itachi thought this was
too difficult for Sasuke

116
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:47,628
and wouldn't allow him to go.

117
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:50,130
You'll have to
exercise extreme caution.

118
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:55,145
<i>So that's what was bothering Sasuke.</i>

119
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,043
<i>I'll go beyond the boundary he set.</i>

120
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,610
Hey, Sasuke. Let's change into cats
and infiltrate that fortress!

121
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:14,655
I guess the best way to infiltrate
a fortress of cats is to become one.

122
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,570
<i>Transformation Jutsu!</i>

123
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:23,622
That's supposed to be a cat?!

124
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,867
I thought I looked pretty good.

125
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:30,209
You don't have to transform.

126
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,449
Besides, transforming won't let
you understand what the cats are saying.

127
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:39,917
And so! If you put these on,
the cats will think you're one of them!

128
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,144
If it's that simple, why didn't you give
these to me from the start?!

129
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:50,311
<i>I-I'm expected to wear this?!</i>

130
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:01,609
We're known in these parts,
so we can't go any further.

131
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,804
No ninja cat has ever
seen Nekomata's face.

132
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:06,993
Will you be able to find him?

133
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:10,460
Thanks to these,
infiltrating will be quite easy.

134
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,310
<i>You look so cute, Sasuke!</i>

135
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,618
If we can get in successfully,
the rest will be easy.

136
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,554
Let's go!

137
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,303
Hold it.

138
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:25,754
Sasuke, we're supposed to be able
to talk to ninja cats with this thing.

139
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,162
Meaning there's no need
to start a fight.

140
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:30,456
Let's just talk it out with him.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,641
I'm sure he'll be happy to give us
a paw print or two.

142
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,667
Impossible.

143
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,361
Why's that?

144
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,591
Having your paw print taken is
extremely embarrassing for a cat.

145
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:47,026
For a human, it's like being stripped naked
and having your picture taken.

146
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:52,686
What's the big deal? A nude photo?
Just sweet-talk 'em a little.

147
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:55,091
I mean, even Sakura would allow it.

148
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,534
Right, Sakura?

149
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,554
As if I would, you pervert!

150
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,806
I think talking will be useless.

151
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,980
Thanks for showing us the way.

152
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:07,382
Get going, pervert.

153
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,276
Next!

154
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,491
I don't recognize you guys.

155
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,493
We're new here!

156
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,411
Here.

157
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:31,306
For someone new,
you're quick to catch on.

158
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,337
What gave us away?!

159
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:36,439
Like I know!

160
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,407
This is a reward for you.

161
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,079
New cats who get it
are always welcome!

162
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:46,968
What's the matter?
You're welcome to it.

163
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:50,606
W-We have to play along or
they'll get suspicious.

164
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,628
<i>I have to do this... to get
Nekomata's paw print!</i>

165
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:01,289
Hey, this is kind of fun.

166
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,304
Stupid sneeze!

167
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,541
This is fun.

168
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,755
A human! There's a human in our midst!

169
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,713
Huh?! Wh-What are you talking about?!

170
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,224
You idiot! Let's go!

171
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,712
Hey, those two are suspicious too!

172
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,529
They're impostors! Alert! Alert!

173
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,519
S-Sasuke! Sakura!

174
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,176
O-Okay, I get it!

175
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,378
I'm guessing you're telling me
to leave, right?

176
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,120
Okay, I'm going.

177
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,283
Damn it!
Now I have to start all over!

178
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,153
What's with all this security?
What's going on?

179
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,644
I heard some human slipped in.

180
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:06,219
A human?!
If he's nearby, I'll snare him!

181
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,847
We don't have to worry about Naruto.

182
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,626
We'll take advantage of the commotion
and search for Nekomata.

183
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:17,022
Sakura, you start from the east tower.
I'll take the west.

184
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:20,447
Huh? Shouldn't we at least work
in pairs for this?

185
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:24,237
They already know we've infiltrated.
Time is of the essence.

186
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:27,212
It's smarter to split up and search.

187
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,698
O-Okay, I understand.

188
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,877
What's all the commotion?

189
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:40,170
Boss! A human! There's a human
who slipped into the fortress!

190
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:44,674
A human infiltrator?!
Kick him out this instant!

191
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,301
Right!

192
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:52,273
A human? We haven't had one of those
here in seven years...

193
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,395
No, it couldn't be.

194
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,699
<i>If I can't get past the front gate,</i>

195
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:17,351
<i>I'll just sneak in from
the side like a ninja.</i>

196
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:33,749
<i>The best place to
get information is a bar.</i>

197
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:00,099
Your silvervine drink, miss.

198
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,712
Oh... I didn't order yet.

199
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,928
It's from that customer over there.

200
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,257
May I join you?

201
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,638
Oh, yes.

202
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,966
A new acquaintance!
This calls for a treat!

203
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,682
You've gotta try this, it's so good!

204
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:39,528
Say, do you know a cat named Nekomata?

205
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,038
You mean, Boss?

206
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,056
He always stays in
the main fortress tower.

207
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,811
Oh, thank you.

208
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,285
You can have this.

209
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:04,122
Booby-trapped water bottles?!

210
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:08,193
These are supposed to be used
against cats, not by cats!

211
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,180
B-Boss is in the main tower.

212
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,348
We've been beaten!

213
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,294
So you made it all the way here.

214
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:39,196
Kid, who are you?

215
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,043
Are you Nekomata?

216
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:45,125
It'll be easy if you willingly
offer your paw.

217
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,358
If not,
it'll probably be quite painful.

218
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,303
You have the guts to stand before me
and make such threats.

219
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:06,427
What is this?

220
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:16,845
Who are you?

221
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,056
Disappear!

222
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,301
Mission accomplished!

223
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,550
You drew an unlucky number
that time, Nekomata.

224
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,842
I wanted to test my skills against him,

225
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,152
since he's Itachi's little brother.

226
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:58,496
Besides, it was a request from Itachi
that I couldn't refuse.

227
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:02,450
M-Monster!

228
00:19:03,694 --> 00:19:06,322
In time, my younger brother will come.

229
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,666
When he does,
fight him with all your might.

230
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:11,978
Although, with your strength,

231
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,210
my brother isn't strong enough
to beat you yet.

232
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,214
Then why?!

233
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,630
Growth occurs when one
goes beyond one's limits.

234
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,721
Realizing that is
also part of training.

235
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:31,374
I hate to admit it, but Sasuke passed
Itachi's test with flying colors.

236
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,864
Indeed.

237
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,632
But how unfortunate...

238
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,988
Those two brothers were so close.

239
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:54,669
This time, nothing's gonna stop me
from seeing it!

240
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:57,266
But how are you going to see it?

241
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,413
That's...

242
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,633
We'll see it somehow...

243
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,936
I'm asking how, you idiot!

244
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,892
Well, then, do you have
a better plan, Sakura?

245
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,086
That's...

246
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,402
We'll tail his every move.

247
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,767
If we do that, he'll eventually
take his mask off.

248
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,260
Sasuke, you're a genius!

249
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,809
What's the big deal?
That's a completely ordinary idea!

250
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:20,971
Did you say something?

251
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:23,062
Well, that's fine.

252
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,055
What's Kakashi-sensei doing?

253
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:37,912
I'm disappointed in him.

254
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
He noticed us!

255
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:43,114
Stupid Naruto!
We were found because of you!

256
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,989
I'm telling you, it's not my fault!

257
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:46,348
What?!

258
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:50,549
I-It's being made into a movie?!

259
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,441
I'm going to go buy
an advance ticket.

260
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,319
Hey, he's begun to move!

261
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:57,774
Let's tail him!

262
00:20:58,251 --> 00:20:58,889
Yeah!

263
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,451
What? He's gone!

264
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:07,323
Damn, he got away...

265
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:10,256
Damn it, where did he go?

266
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,274
What are you guys doing?

267
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,594
Did you three need something from me?

268
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,540
- N-Not really...
- N-Not really...

269
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,491
Seriously, those eyes.

270
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,806
They look like they want
to devour me.

271
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:32,031
Oh, come on!
I think it's kind of cute.

272
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:37,587
Anyway, you got the luck of the draw.
So you have to take care of it.

273
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,985
Don't worry.
You two make quite a pair.

274
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't know how you can say that!

275
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:51,018
Ow! Hey, cut it out!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

276
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,997
A stray cat, a stray dog, a stray pig...

277
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,083
And now, a stray ostrich?

278
00:21:57,937 --> 00:21:59,689
We may be going up in scale,

279
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:03,853
but I don't see how these
stupid missions will improve our skills.

280
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:05,748
Missions, eh?

281
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,011
The purpose of this
isn't to improve your skills.

282
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,768
You're not undergoing training.

283
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,610
<i>Although I understand
why you're impatient.</i>

284
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:25,343
In that case, use this ostrich
to improve your skills!

285
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,078
Hey, what are you doing?!

286
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:28,631
- Shut up and improve your skills!
- Yeah, it's your responsibility!

287
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:30,074
I'm letting you have it! Oww!

288
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,200
Oww!

289
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:34,245
Oww! Oww!

290
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:44,505
We'll find an inn for the night.
Mr. Ostrich looks worn out too.

291
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:48,302
Jeez... If it were just us,

292
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,871
we could've made it back
to the village tonight.

293
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,225
Huh? What's that?!

294
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:58,014
I'm gonna take a look!

295
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,957
Naruto! Not again!

296
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:01,653
Oww!

297
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,232
Let's go.

298
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:04,358
What could it be?

299
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:05,868
Not you too!

300
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:08,761
Huh?

301
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:11,324
A fight?

302
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,600
No, it seems to be a vendetta.

303
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,143
A vendetta?

304
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:18,979
You mean like when
someone fights for revenge?

305
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,045
Revenge...

306
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:24,922
Revenge... on a busy street
in the middle of the day?

307
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,865
Is that okay, Kakashi-sensei?

308
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,700
A vendetta permit, huh?

309
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:34,514
Depending on the land,
if someone is murdered,

310
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,625
the family members are given
permission to seek revenge.

311
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,069
As long as he has
an authorized permit from that land,

312
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:43,802
other nations will allow the vendetta.

313
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:48,694
I heard that man, Tsukado,
had a distant relative.

314
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:51,697
And that killer over there called
the relative out late one night.

315
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:55,818
Then he ambushed him from behind
and killed him with a rock.

316
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,120
Awful story, huh?

317
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,038
The killer escaped and
the family wanted revenge.

318
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:03,274
And that man was chosen for the task.

319
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,296
What a villain.

320
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,092
Boss Kanabun,
it looks like a vendetta.

321
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:17,139
Now this is interesting.
Who do you think will win, boys?

322
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:21,410
Well... They say the hunter is
usually stronger than the hunted.

323
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,706
Nah, I'm not with you there.

324
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:28,484
The hunted one has a pretty mean look.

325
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:41,789
He's going for it!

326
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:42,498
No!

327
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:44,208
Whoa...

328
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,793
Huh?!

329
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,505
Hmm...

330
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,606
Looks like he won't be
getting his revenge.

331
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,892
What?!

332
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:08,445
Hey! Hold it!
Hey! You bastard!

333
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,572
Damn you...

334
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:15,656
Here!

335
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,909
Oh, thanks.

336
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:21,495
I almost had him.

337
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,956
It didn't look that way.

338
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:27,244
Amateurs can keep their opinions
to themselves.

339
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:31,339
I may not look it,
but I'm a veteran of 34 vendettas.

340
00:25:32,173 --> 00:25:33,174
Oh...

341
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,928
What?! You mean you've failed
34 times already?!

342
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,304
Next time, for sure!

343
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:39,764
I think not!

344
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,725
There's no way to know
that unless I try.

345
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:44,685
Next time, on my 35th attempt,

346
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,686
I may just successfully complete
my vendetta. Isn't that so?

347
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:52,735
All right, I understand!

348
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:54,403
Huh?

349
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:56,697
I'll help you!

350
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,870
I'll use every ninja skill I know
to help you with your vendetta!

351
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:06,498
Huh?

352
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,126
Stupid Naruto!
Getting carried away like that!

353
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,629
Well,
let's leave Naruto to handle this.

354
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:14,131
We'll take a break at the inn.

355
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:16,133
Ridiculous.

356
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,595
Mister, leave it to me!

357
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:25,685
Lesson One!

358
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,855
You don't have enough anger
towards your enemy!

359
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:33,734
You need to be able to explode
with rage at any moment.

360
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:36,904
Then you'll never be caught
off guard for a vendetta!

361
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:38,698
Right...

362
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,368
Hey, you there!

363
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,987
Be careful, old lady!
Damn you, get on my back!

364
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,241
Well? Where are you headed then?!

365
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:51,002
The next town? Just the next town?!

366
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:52,628
That's it!? That's hardly anywhere!

367
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:56,590
- I don't care if it's far. Jeez.
- Um... That's not what I meant.

368
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,953
Lesson Two!

369
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,139
Take all vendettas seriously,
even the easy ones.

370
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:04,849
Get used to taking revenge!

371
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,267
Uh-huh.

372
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:09,603
Hey...

373
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:11,707
I shall assist!

374
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:12,813
Huh?

375
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:15,456
This one's for the shoulder!

376
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,236
- The shoulder! The shoulder!
- S-Stop it!

377
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,763
- The shoulder! The shoulder!
<i>- That's not what I meant either.</i>

378
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,284
Lesson Three!

379
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,221
Fill your mind with images of
your enemy until it's ready to burst,

380
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,581
then manifest your anger on paper.

381
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:30,207
Uh-huh...

382
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:39,759
How... How come your hated enemy
looks so nice?

383
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:46,067
You know, I don't think
you're cut out for vendettas.

384
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,960
And you're not cut out to be a teacher.

385
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,289
Do you have to carry out the vendetta?

386
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:56,916
Yeah. I can't return home unless I do.

387
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,985
I want to finish this and go home.
To my aging mother and father.

388
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:08,922
An ostrich is running wild!

389
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:20,257
M-Mister?

390
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,868
That guy... Was he hiding his skills?

391
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:24,804
Boys!

392
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:25,846
Right!

393
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,725
Sorry. The ostrich bit through
its leash.

394
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:38,944
As I had suspected,
you are a master swordsman.

395
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,027
Huh?

396
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:42,690
What's going on?

397
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:47,090
If you're that strong,
why can't you finish your vendetta?

398
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:50,037
I don't know.

399
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:54,877
It's just that, when I look into his eyes
the strength drains out of me.

400
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:00,654
It's those eyes.
It's those eyes that...

401
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,144
Mister...

402
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:14,728
I wonder what happened to that man.

403
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,566
He probably set out in pursuit
of his enemy.

404
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,610
Will he be doing that
the rest of his life?

405
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,070
What's going on?!

406
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,718
How's that, Mr. Vendetta?

407
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,621
I was so moved by your resolve.

408
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:37,084
So I brought your enemy to you...
You can now take your revenge.

409
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:41,005
Let's see you pay him back
to your heart's content.

410
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,009
Mister...

411
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,206
Whoa!

412
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:50,276
However, we of the Kanabun Gang
will oversee this vendetta.

413
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:52,339
All right, one and all!

414
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,643
Who's gonna win this vendetta?!

415
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,711
Place your bets now!

416
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,049
Who's the stronger one?

417
00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:00,603
It's gotta be the one taking revenge!

418
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:03,493
He looks hopeless.
No way he'll win!

419
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:05,612
I bet 500 ryo on his foe!

420
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:06,614
Me too!

421
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,742
If you're short on cash,

422
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,952
the Kanabun Gang will place
a bet for you!

423
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:15,973
If that guy uses his real strength,
this fight...

424
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:19,627
Yeah. We'll make a tidy profit.

425
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,381
That's terrible.
Making a buck off of his vendetta.

426
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:29,261
It all ends here.

427
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,806
Well... I can't die yet.

428
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:37,978
On guard.

429
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,780
<i>What?! He's going to fight without
looking his opponent in the eye!</i>

430
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,457
He just might win!

431
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:01,460
Don't tell me
Naruto's lessons helped.

432
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:10,302
I... I don't like this fight.

433
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:12,199
I wonder why...

434
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:18,018
It's him. Just like Mister said.

435
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:20,688
That guy's face... His eyes...

436
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:31,688
Those eyes again!

437
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:33,997
How can you be like that?!

438
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:36,791
You could be killed by me, so why?!

439
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:43,000
Why doesn't that guy
try to kill Tsukado?

440
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,592
Well then...

441
00:31:57,891 --> 00:31:59,518
Wait!

442
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,706
The reason why
you couldn't kill this guy...

443
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:08,944
Deep down, you know why, don't you?

444
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:15,909
Yeah... I realized it just now.

445
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,646
I see... The blade has been dulled.

446
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:23,125
This man can't kill anyone.

447
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,091
I have a twin brother named Kageki.

448
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,928
A twin... brother?

449
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:39,141
Kageki had loaned money to Shikazo,
a member of your family.

450
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,603
But then, my brother had
a child and he needed money.

451
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:45,064
So he went back to ask to be repaid.

452
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:49,276
Shikazo ignored my brother and
tried to get out of paying him back.

453
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:54,615
A scuffle broke out and
they both fell to the dirt floor.

454
00:32:55,201 --> 00:33:01,833
At that moment, Shikazo hit his head
on a pickling stone and died.

455
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,026
Are you saying it was an accident?

456
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,601
Kageki said he was going
to turn himself in.

457
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:10,297
But there were no witnesses.

458
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,149
Considering the circumstances,

459
00:33:12,174 --> 00:33:14,635
he'd probably have been
accused of murder.

460
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,762
So I offered to switch places with him.

461
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,764
What?

462
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:21,225
I took his identity

463
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:26,021
and sent him and his wife,
who had just given birth, into hiding.

464
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:28,791
In order to buy them time,

465
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:31,819
I deliberately drew the attention
of the pursuers to myself.

466
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:35,697
I couldn't let a great guy
like him ruin his life.

467
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:38,487
Whereas I've been a scoundrel

468
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:40,973
who's caused nothing
but grief to my family and to society.

469
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:46,333
I figured it was my way of atoning.

470
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:49,728
I only have my
younger brother's word for it.

471
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:55,065
There's no way to prove it,
but I trust him.

472
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,345
Mister...

473
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:03,058
It's up to you whether
you believe me or not.

474
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:07,521
If you don't... Then kill me.

475
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,445
Well then, I'm going to believe you.

476
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,803
- You...
- Mister!

477
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:19,491
Actually, I'm sick and tired of
this whole revenge business.

478
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,195
If you've pretended all these years
to be my foe...

479
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:27,286
Well, starting now,
I'll just pretend that I'm on a vendetta.

480
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,968
The way this ended...
It was okay, right, Kakashi-sensei?

481
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:41,013
Well...
That's for those two to decide.

482
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,928
Revenge is a hard thing, isn't it?

483
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,228
What would you know?

484
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,480
Huh?

485
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:52,691
Sometimes, revenge is necessary,
no matter how hard it is.

486
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:05,010
Hey, how did he spot us?

487
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,267
Isn't it because there
are too many of us?

488
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,442
If you erase your presence,
the number of people doesn't matter.

489
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:15,121
Or did you forget the jutsu, Sakura?

490
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:16,958
That's you!

491
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,431
It will be good training to shadow him.

492
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,830
From now on,
we'll go about it individually.

493
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:25,418
Y-Yeah,
let's just leave Naruto here!

494
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:27,227
What?!

495
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:36,157
And Junko says...
"Oh, I'm losing you."

496
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,123
What? What?

497
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,701
He got away...

498
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:02,725
Clumsy as usual...

499
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,448
You idiot...

500
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:06,108
Sorry.

501
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:19,330
Gosh, what is Kakashi-sensei doing?

502
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:21,989
He hasn't moved for such a long time...

503
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:24,908
No way!

504
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,093
Sasuke! How did it go?!

505
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,592
No more shadowing.

506
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,113
People of the Leaf Village.

507
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:10,078
I'm here to offer you a moment
of respite with my song and dance.

508
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:19,210
<i>Hanare...</i>

509
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,609
Hey. Good job on another mission.

510
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:42,890
Now I can finally eat Ichiraku ramen!

511
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,947
Sounds good. You're treating, Naruto.

512
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:50,035
Huh? Oh, fine. But you know...

513
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,896
How about you treat us
for a change, Sasuke?

514
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,666
I'm off to train.

515
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,501
Then, maybe Kakashi-sensei can...

516
00:37:58,448 --> 00:37:59,449
Huh?

517
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,557
Wow...

518
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:14,283
She's beautiful.

519
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:16,645
Was she arrested?

520
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,549
I'm told she's a kunoichi who
disguised herself as a street performer

521
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:29,700
to gather intelligence
on the Land of Fire.

522
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,495
What's going to happen
to her now?

523
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:38,708
Well, she'll be interrogated to
see just what she found out.

524
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,461
They'll use whatever
means necessary.

525
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,222
Until she starts talking.

526
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:03,942
Welcome.

527
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,486
To the "Honesty Room."

528
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,628
She's been trained well
to resist your interrogation.

529
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:25,756
Not even a single moan, sir.

530
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,350
Only the sound of
her gritting her teeth.

531
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,052
What an impressive kunoichi.

532
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:37,755
Well then... We'll have to reach into
that silence and find her inner voice.

533
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:39,242
I understand.

534
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,674
Then please summon Inoichi.

535
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,307
<i>They look... like clouds.</i>

536
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:53,334
<i>Just like the ones
from that day.</i>

537
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,166
We're done with the pain.

538
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:03,598
Time for a more humane approach.

539
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:35,977
<i>Hanare...</i>

540
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:41,297
<i>Infiltrate the Land of Fire and
investigate the Hidden Leaf.</i>

541
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:44,396
<i>The Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

542
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:52,050
<i>Our nation has survived through the years
not by military strength, but by espionage.</i>

543
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,116
<i>We use the information we gather to
plan strategies and gain the advantage</i>

544
00:40:56,198 --> 00:41:00,828
<i>in diplomatic negotiations with
other nations to avert conflict.</i>

545
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:07,207
<i>The fate of our nation rests
in your hands, Hanare.</i>

546
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,192
<i>Yes sir!
I will not fail you.</i>

547
00:41:19,669 --> 00:41:20,670
What's that?

548
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:23,417
That headband...

549
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:27,460
It belongs to the Hidden Lock Village
in the Land of Key.

550
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,424
She was captured before
she had infiltrated the Hidden Leaf.

551
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:02,704
She didn't learn anything
of importance.

552
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:09,726
Sorry, but now it's my turn to get
some information about your village.

553
00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:26,141
What's going on?

554
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:29,195
She has no memories
about her village at all.

555
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:37,078
Was it my imagination?

556
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:00,553
What?

557
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:05,174
Memories of me as a kid?

558
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,350
Yeah, do you remember anything?

559
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:11,398
No, I've never met her.

560
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:13,984
I see.

561
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,945
Did you learn anything else?

562
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,096
Nothing significant.

563
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:23,034
And she had no memories
of the Lock Village.

564
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:25,807
She probably purged it.

565
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:27,542
Purged?

566
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:32,286
But, something is bothering me.
Just something...

567
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:35,463
Part of it is the fact that
she had memories of you.

568
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,757
But she's hiding something.

569
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:40,885
Something that even I can't dig up.

570
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,132
And that, Kakashi, is what
I want you to find out.

571
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,268
Huh? Me?

572
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:50,860
But I'm not a member of
the Intel Division.

573
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:56,409
You might be able to see
deeper into her mind.

574
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:19,924
Are you a fool?

575
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:23,720
You're showing me around the very
village I came to spy on.

576
00:44:24,304 --> 00:44:27,474
You won't find anything different
here than in any other village.

577
00:44:28,475 --> 00:44:31,603
Besides, I thought you could use some
fresh air after being in that stuffy room.

578
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:48,364
Which flower should I choose?

579
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:51,164
What?

580
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:52,749
Uh-huh...

581
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:53,750
Uh-huh...

582
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,251
What? No way!

583
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,228
What?!

584
00:44:58,055 --> 00:44:59,932
Kakashi-sensei?!

585
00:45:08,065 --> 00:45:09,066
Kakashi?

586
00:45:10,053 --> 00:45:11,893
Are you curious too?

587
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,419
It's not like that.

588
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:14,930
It's that lady!

589
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:17,273
What's Kakashi doing with
someone like her?

590
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:19,734
Hey!

591
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,546
Come over here.

592
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,601
It's not like I'm trying to
get information out of you.

593
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:57,480
I was just asked to spend
the day with you.

594
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,850
Once the day is done,
so is my duty.

595
00:46:02,439 --> 00:46:03,607
What will happen to me?

596
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:05,518
Who knows?

597
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:10,802
That cloud resembles Naruto.

598
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,122
And next to that is...
Sasuke, maybe?

599
00:46:17,753 --> 00:46:21,966
I see... my mother and father,
who gave me life.

600
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,299
Although I never met them.

601
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:30,651
When things got hard, when I was sad,
I always looked up at the clouds.

602
00:46:32,307 --> 00:46:35,768
I'd stare at the clouds
and imagine.

603
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:37,658
Life in the village...

604
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,047
And my parents who
supposedly live there.

605
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:42,775
Otherwise,
I couldn't have endured.

606
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:46,112
Not knowing who my parents were,
and not knowing about my village.

607
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:49,991
And my fate of being born just
to be a spy.

608
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:55,263
I can't hear them.

609
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:58,625
But they seem suited
for each other.

610
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,417
How silly.

611
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:02,595
I'm going to get closer.

612
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:04,883
I don't know my village.

613
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:06,910
I was raised outside the village,

614
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:10,712
so that I couldn't divulge any
information in case I was captured.

615
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:15,948
And to this day, I risked my life
to carry out missions

616
00:47:15,973 --> 00:47:18,475
for a homeland
I've never even seen.

617
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,639
That's why it meant everything...

618
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,069
To have a home.
To have people who would accept me.

619
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,626
Why tell me?

620
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,047
You've remained silent
all this time.

621
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:37,372
That's because...

622
00:47:38,665 --> 00:47:40,416
you taught me.

623
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,212
I knew the moment I saw you.

624
00:47:45,546 --> 00:47:47,173
That you were the boy
from back then.

625
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:56,224
I wanted to see my parents
and I set out for the village.

626
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,396
But I got lost and
was feeling helpless.

627
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:15,785
You told me to look up at the clouds
whenever I'm feeling lonely.

628
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:20,536
Because clouds change their form,
you can imagine anything you wish for.

629
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:25,628
You said as long as you have hope,
the clouds will always answer your call.

630
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,866
I always searched for
your likeness in the clouds.

631
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:47,879
So I recognized you immediately,
even though you've changed quite a bit.

632
00:48:49,067 --> 00:48:51,611
Because you've always
been in my heart.

633
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,982
You were my hope.

634
00:48:57,991 --> 00:49:01,001
Whoa... Things are
starting to heat up.

635
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,750
Wait, Naruto! You'll...

636
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:16,942
Hey, you three!

637
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,260
Huh?! Uh...
You see, this is...

638
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:19,702
Give me that!
Give me that!

639
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:22,101
C-Congratulations!

640
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:24,312
Huh?

641
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,841
Thank you.

642
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:44,499
The Lock Village has captured 
one of our Jonin, Riichi.

643
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:45,986
The Lock Village?

644
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:49,207
You mean the village where
that kunoichi is from?

645
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:50,743
Yes...

646
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:55,468
And the other side has proposed
to exchange Riichi for Hanare.

647
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:59,364
Fortunately, it seems Hanare
holds very little information

648
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:02,266
about the Land of Fire and
the Leaf Village.

649
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:05,144
So releasing her would be harmless.

650
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:07,353
No, you can't!

651
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:10,550
I'm against sending Hanare back!

652
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:32,713
It's not a Transformation Jutsu.

653
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:35,466
That is definitely Riichi.

654
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:41,555
All right! One man from each side
will accompany their prisoner,

655
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:45,132
and the exchange will be made
at the center of the bridge.

656
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:46,932
Agreed?

657
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:48,848
Agreed!

658
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,242
Kakashi-sensei...

659
00:50:55,695 --> 00:50:57,415
I never thought it would
turn out like this.

660
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,503
I won't let you go.

661
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,197
Hanare!

662
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:42,350
Bring back information on
the Hidden Leaf without fail!

663
00:51:46,245 --> 00:51:48,206
Retreat!

664
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,701
It's begun!

665
00:52:02,845 --> 00:52:05,431
Old man, give up!

666
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:10,061
Don't underestimate the ninja of the Lock.

667
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:14,437
Once our secrets are locked away,
not even death can open them!

668
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,788
Kakashi-sensei!

669
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:14,646
Where's Hanare?

670
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,916
She must have felt cornered
and gave up.

671
00:53:20,423 --> 00:53:21,632
She jumped off the cliff.

672
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:24,661
She was a fine ninja.

673
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:28,931
- No...
- Are you okay with this, Kakashi-sensei?!

674
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:32,493
What if that woman
really did love you?

675
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:33,519
Enough!

676
00:53:34,228 --> 00:53:35,229
It's pointless.

677
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:05,710
Off we go!

678
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:08,554
<i>Today's mission is to help at a farm.</i>

679
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:11,098
<i>The mission itself is no big deal.</i>

680
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,060
<i>We're definitely going to look at it...</i>

681
00:54:14,477 --> 00:54:16,797
<i>- Kakashi-sensei's real face!
- Kakashi-sensei's real face!</i>

682
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:20,775
What's the matter?

683
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:22,652
You all seem pretty fired up today.

684
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:24,862
- I have lots of energy!
- I'm ready to go!

685
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:29,075
Oh, that's excellent.

686
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:35,118
I've finally found you...

687
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:40,221
Kakashi Hatake!

688
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,463
Kakashi...

689
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,299
It has been a long while,

690
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,968
but I'm here to settle our score!

691
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:50,054
Boss, what is your grudge?

692
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:53,521
Fool! Have you forgotten?!

693
00:54:54,618 --> 00:54:55,953
I cannot forget.

694
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:58,932
It happened three years ago,
in the spring...

695
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:00,231
No!

696
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,710
You don't need to be that scared.

697
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:04,235
No!

698
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:08,508
Our boss wants a word with you...

699
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:10,783
Your boss?!

700
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:24,588
I love you... Please marry me!

701
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,757
- Boss is so cool!
- Boss is so cool!

702
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:27,737
No...

703
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,668
There's no need to be embarrassed.

704
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:33,514
You can be honest and
fly into my arms.

705
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,541
No...

706
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:39,937
Don't worry.
Even though I look like this,

707
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,170
I've got plenty of money!

708
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:44,030
I am telling you, no!

709
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:48,092
What? You're turning me down
in these surroundings?

710
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:50,731
When I say no, I mean no!

711
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:54,493
I made this setting so romantic
for you, so why?

712
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,454
I just don't like you!

713
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,581
Why don't you stop right there?

714
00:55:58,659 --> 00:55:59,659
- Huh?
- Huh?

715
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,938
Hey, the girl doesn't like it
and no matter how you look at it,

716
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,090
you're being rejected, buddy.

717
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:09,592
Yeah, yeah.

718
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:11,552
You're pretty gutsy.

719
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:14,263
Do you have any idea who we are?!

720
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:18,893
Are you challenging us, knowing that
we are the Moya Ninja Trio...

721
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:20,681
fearsome enough to silence
a crying child?!

722
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:24,150
Moya Ninja...? Never heard of them.

723
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,436
You don't know Moya Ninja...?!

724
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:28,630
How dare you make fools of us!

725
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,321
Who the hell are you?

726
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:33,257
I'm hardly worth introducing, but...

727
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:35,201
Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.

728
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,079
- You're introducing yourself!
- You're introducing yourself!

729
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,137
Hey you...

730
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,705
You're going to regret it.

731
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,000
For getting in the way of
someone's romance!

732
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,501
Romance?

733
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:47,254
Sounds more like you're just
harassing her.

734
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:49,433
Enough!

735
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,259
Men! We're going to attack!

736
00:56:52,343 --> 00:56:53,093
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

737
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,471
4... 3... 2... 1...

738
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,515
- Hustle! Hustle!
- Hustle! Hustle!

739
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:09,360
Please! Somebody help me!

740
00:57:09,502 --> 00:57:10,781
Hey! I hate heights!

741
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:11,949
I'll take you back to the village.

742
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:12,905
Stop talking! Hey!

743
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:15,950
Hey, quit sighing!
What, are you just leaving us here?!

744
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,245
That's how it went...

745
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,304
- Don't be so proud!
- Don't be so proud!

746
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:21,455
- You lost!
- You lost!

747
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:24,616
So, this is revenge for what
happened three years ago?

748
00:57:24,792 --> 00:57:26,836
Boss has become stronger
in the last three years,

749
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,531
and he's going to crush him
in a head-on match!

750
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:31,298
That's so dramatic!

751
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,469
Fool! Who would take such a risk?!

752
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:36,685
Huh?

753
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:38,430
If we're going to do it,

754
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,386
we'll do it from the shadows!
Secretly.

755
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:45,124
- D-Dirty!
- D-Dirty!

756
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,014
Welcome!

757
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:51,836
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

758
00:57:51,861 --> 00:57:53,070
Welcome!

759
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:00,311
Incredible!

760
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,409
Looks delicious!

761
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:03,641
How extravagant.

762
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,730
Please take your time...

763
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:14,216
<i>Kakashi...</i>

764
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,969
<i>Enjoy your meal. It'll be your last.</i>

765
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,598
<i>That meal contains
a tasteless and odorless medicine</i>

766
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,018
<i>that causes uncontrollable hiccups.</i>

767
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,606
<i>Just keep hiccuping ceaselessly
and die suffering!</i>

768
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,610
<i>It's a fitting end for you!</i>

769
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:37,990
Something wrong?

770
00:58:38,407 --> 00:58:40,209
None of you has touched your food.

771
00:58:40,234 --> 00:58:44,238
Not really, but Kakashi-sensei,
why don't you hurry up and eat?

772
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:47,291
Well, I'm on a diet.

773
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,106
<i>Figured he'd say something like that.</i>

774
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:54,010
<i>Then I'll strip off that mask
if it kills me!</i>

775
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,842
My hands slipped...

776
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:13,400
How could you!

777
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:15,736
Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally...

778
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:18,298
- What do you mean "unintentionally"?!
- What do you mean "unintentionally"?!

779
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,950
<i>What a pity! The meal...</i>

780
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:23,475
<i>- How could he do such a thing
- How could he do such a thing</i>

781
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:27,831
Hey, what's the next move?

782
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:30,709
Don't worry. I have an idea.

783
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,423
- An idea?
- An idea?

784
00:59:39,843 --> 00:59:43,013
I see, that's pretty good thinking
for Sasuke.

785
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:45,432
A person would normally
take off the mask here.

786
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:48,018
Never mind that.
Just be quiet, you idiot!

787
00:59:52,147 --> 00:59:55,025
Kakashi, you will die here!

788
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,670
From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,

789
00:59:57,695 --> 01:00:01,949
coated with a poison I made
that will make you laugh uncontrollably...

790
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,755
You'll die laughing...

791
01:00:17,006 --> 01:00:19,466
That is the fitting way for you...

792
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:21,392
Damn...

793
01:00:21,575 --> 01:00:25,955
I wanted to see it too,
but this is a hot spring...

794
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,599
But I want to see!

795
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,008
Kakashi-sensei!
Aren't you ready yet?

796
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:34,367
All right, I'm coming in now.

797
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:35,983
I do want to see it!

798
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:41,113
Here he comes!

799
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:42,321
Great!

800
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:44,705
Oh, I can't see at all!

801
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:03,594
Thanks for waiting.
I'll just soak for a little while.

802
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,436
- Why is it like this?!
- Why is it like this?!

803
01:01:07,514 --> 01:01:08,514
Now!

804
01:01:09,058 --> 01:01:10,851
Huh? Is something wrong?

805
01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:13,353
And now to slowly sink in.

806
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,533
What the...?!

807
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:29,874
What happened? I want to know!

808
01:01:36,585 --> 01:01:41,590
What in the world is
Kakashi-sensei thinking? Huh?

809
01:01:49,598 --> 01:01:52,726
Damn, I'm completely flushed... Huh?

810
01:01:54,728 --> 01:01:56,568
- Our clothes are gone!
- Our clothes are gone!

811
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,196
Please come again!
Please come again!

812
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:09,213
Thank you for coming!

813
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:11,991
Please come again!
Please come again!

814
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:17,626
Damn... I'm definitely going
to defeat you, Kakashi Hatake!

815
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:21,562
Good thing we brought spare clothes.

816
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:25,187
I wonder who took them...?
Our clothes!

817
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:29,847
All right,
each of you work at your own posts.

818
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:31,515
Now, break up.

819
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,144
I can't stand it anymore...

820
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:37,354
I have too much stress pent up.

821
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,423
I'm almost at the end of
my rope, too...

822
01:02:40,811 --> 01:02:43,439
Sasuke... actually, me too...

823
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:47,156
Then, it's the last resort!

824
01:02:47,656 --> 01:02:49,074
- Last resort?
- Last resort?

825
01:02:50,425 --> 01:02:51,134
What is this?

826
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,436
Can't you see? It's a shinobi outfit.

827
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,623
When did you get this ready?

828
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,197
Well, well, never mind that,
never mind that.

829
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:00,586
What do you do with this?

830
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:05,591
We'll take off that mask.
By force, if we have to!

831
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,439
Damn Kakashi...

832
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:13,673
Boss! Look at that!

833
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,061
Hey, Kakashi Hatake!

834
01:03:18,604 --> 01:03:21,273
Hey, what are you guys up to?

835
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:24,771
W-What are you talking about?
We are simply ninja.

836
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,012
It is not like we want to see
what's behind your mask or anything!

837
01:03:27,196 --> 01:03:30,282
Fool!
Don't say unnecessary things!

838
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:31,527
That's...!

839
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:35,998
Boss! There's someone else besides you
who holds a grudge against Kakashi!

840
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,592
Now is the chance!

841
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:39,041
Right! Let's go!

842
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,082
- Right!
- Right!

843
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:41,919
Stop right there!

844
01:03:44,796 --> 01:03:47,925
Kakashi! It's time for you
to pay for your crime!

845
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:49,927
You shall die!

846
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:54,223
With this medicine I prepared
that will make you cry... What?!

847
01:03:56,767 --> 01:04:00,354
Oh? So, just when I was wondering how long
you guys were going to sneak around...

848
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:03,106
...you finally show yourselves.

849
01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:05,068
Ah, well, you know...

850
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:08,362
But before that,
Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!

851
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:12,366
Why are you guys dressed like that?

852
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,952
Huh?! Well, yeah, so...

853
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:16,620
<i>Oh no...</i>

854
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:18,730
<i>We have to make up an explanation,
whatever it is!</i>

855
01:04:19,706 --> 01:04:20,791
Caught you!

856
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:25,449
We were well aware that
you three were targeting Kakashi-sensei!

857
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:31,113
What?! Then our plot was exposed
from the beginning!

858
01:04:31,343 --> 01:04:35,264
Of course!
This was a trap to lure you guys out!

859
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:37,027
We caught you off guard!

860
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:39,601
So we were completely caught
in the trap.

861
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:42,688
Damn it! We underestimated you,
thinking you were just kids!

862
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,982
<i>I never heard that story!</i>

863
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:46,817
<i>Nice, Sakura!</i>

864
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:51,655
I don't quite get what's happening,
but oh well...

865
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:56,798
- Please forgive us!
- Please forgive us!

866
01:04:58,245 --> 01:04:59,746
There's no use talking...

867
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,165
- O-Oh no!
- S-Stop!

868
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,842
It's the same as three years ago!

869
01:05:11,883 --> 01:05:16,555
This time, we're hung by just one rope,
so our movements are linked.

870
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:19,308
By the way, who are you guys?

871
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:22,069
- And he doesn't even remember us!
- And he doesn't even remember us!

872
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:30,861
Hey, Kakashi-sensei.

873
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:32,321
Yeah?

874
01:05:32,492 --> 01:05:34,952
What is behind that mask?

875
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:37,676
What? You wanted to see
what's under this mask?

876
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:38,359
Yeah!

877
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:40,424
Then you should have said
that from the beginning...

878
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:42,914
Well, can you show us?

879
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:44,541
I don't mind...

880
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:45,583
What the?!

881
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:47,044
Sure thing.

882
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:51,798
All right...

883
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,511
<i>Is it blubbery lips?</i>

884
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:01,223
<i>Buckteeth?</i>

885
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:06,063
<i>Or a tiny mouth?</i>

886
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:08,417
Underneath this mask...

887
01:06:08,822 --> 01:06:10,532
<i>- Underneath this mask...
- Underneath this mask...</i>

888
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,364
There happens to be another mask!

889
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:16,990
- What?!
- What?!

890
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:23,049
What?!

891
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,832
What in the world is that?!

892
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:36,134
According to our intel,
the thieves who took the golden statue

893
01:06:36,182 --> 01:06:38,693
are either taking this forest path

894
01:06:38,718 --> 01:06:42,054
or arriving by boat at this shore.

895
01:06:43,947 --> 01:06:47,742
We're going to split up into
two teams and lie in wait for them.

896
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,565
In terms of balance,

897
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:53,485
I'll go alone,
and the three of you will stick together.

898
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:55,904
What do you mean by that?

899
01:06:56,405 --> 01:06:58,824
Are you saying Sasuke needs
all the help he can get?

900
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:00,666
No, you're the hindrance.

901
01:07:01,326 --> 01:07:05,580
I may not be at your level yet, but
three against one is still unfair.

902
01:07:06,197 --> 01:07:08,366
Why don't you take Naruto
off my hands?

903
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:10,919
Subtract his skill from yours,
and we'll call it even.

904
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:12,212
Huh?!

905
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:15,005
<i>Sasuke, is that just
a clever approach</i>

906
01:07:15,006 --> 01:07:17,843
<i>so that you and I
can be alone together?!</i>

907
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,431
You've got to be kidding!

908
01:07:22,587 --> 01:07:24,756
Why would you subtract my skill?!

909
01:07:25,016 --> 01:07:26,935
Because you have nothing to add.

910
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,086
What?!

911
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:31,773
Sasuke wants to be with me so much,
he's getting impatient!

912
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,299
You're just as irritating!

913
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:41,700
Okay, pay attention.

914
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,995
I'll watch the pier.

915
01:07:45,556 --> 01:07:47,850
And you three will keep an eye
on this path in the forest.

916
01:07:48,656 --> 01:07:51,242
If the thieves appear,
notify me immediately.

917
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:53,264
Do not take them lightly.

918
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:56,427
Our mission is to retrieve
the golden statue.

919
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:59,217
We must proceed with utmost caution.

920
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:04,723
If the thieves appear on my side,
I will send a signal with this.

921
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:07,433
When this lightning barrel
is tossed into the air,

922
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,710
it will release a thunderbolt.

923
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,607
Once you see it,
rush straight to that location.

924
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:17,360
You better handle that with care.

925
01:08:17,777 --> 01:08:18,778
Now remember.

926
01:08:18,904 --> 01:08:21,072
You are not to act alone.

927
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,375
<i>It's the gang of thieves!</i>

928
01:08:47,933 --> 01:08:48,934
Why you...

929
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:50,602
Idiot!

930
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,765
Careful with the treasure!

931
01:08:53,438 --> 01:08:55,482
I'm sorry, Boss Jako!

932
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,758
Shape up!

933
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:57,983
Yes sir!

934
01:08:58,253 --> 01:09:00,630
<i>Treasure?! In that wicker box?</i>

935
01:09:01,446 --> 01:09:04,533
<i>This is... my chance!</i>

936
01:09:05,343 --> 01:09:07,928
<i>Amazing, Naruto!</i>

937
01:09:07,953 --> 01:09:10,038
<i>You really showed Sasuke up!</i>

938
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:17,448
<i>Don't tell me he's up to the same...</i>

939
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:20,973
<i>I won't lose to him!</i>

940
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:30,892
W-What's this?

941
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,013
Damn! The treasure!

942
01:09:43,293 --> 01:09:45,336
<i>What are those two doing?!</i>

943
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:47,739
<i>We have to notify
Kakashi-sensei first!</i>

944
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:50,684
What? There's another one?

945
01:10:12,851 --> 01:10:15,020
Let go of the treasure!

946
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:16,771
No way!

947
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:18,000
Take this!

948
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:32,076
I won't lose it.

949
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:40,123
Huh?

950
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:50,096
Damn it.

951
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,560
Pursuers from
the Hidden Leaf, eh?

952
01:11:01,608 --> 01:11:03,860
Were those two
the only ones with you?

953
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,866
There must be others.

954
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:13,578
That's why you tried to get word out
about this location.

955
01:11:27,518 --> 01:11:28,811
Impressive, huh?

956
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,997
I'm a natural-born thief,
rotten to the core.

957
01:11:33,143 --> 01:11:37,731
So as you can see,
even my chakra is foul.

958
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,679
Those two escaped downriver.

959
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:46,932
We'll split up and concentrate our search
along the river and we'll find them.

960
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:48,501
And we'll take back the treasure.

961
01:11:49,197 --> 01:11:50,448
What about her?

962
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:52,641
We might be able to use her
as a hostage.

963
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:53,959
Bring her with us.

964
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:06,347
I can't believe they stole
something stupid like this.

965
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:08,841
The thunder...

966
01:12:08,942 --> 01:12:09,896
Huh?

967
01:12:09,921 --> 01:12:13,591
The signal flare for Kakashi
didn't go off, did it?

968
01:12:13,864 --> 01:12:14,683
No.

969
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,003
Maybe Sakura couldn't release it.

970
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:21,396
Sakura's been captured?!

971
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:27,569
- Huh?
- Huh?

972
01:12:28,383 --> 01:12:29,050
Wha-?

973
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:29,742
- Huh?
- Huh?

974
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:31,964
- What is this?!
- What is this?!

975
01:12:32,799 --> 01:12:35,260
W-What's going on?

976
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:36,619
We're stuck together.

977
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,500
- Ready... pull!
- Ready... pull!

978
01:13:59,088 --> 01:14:01,007
Why is it always with you?!

979
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:03,081
That's my line!

980
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,750
Don't worry.
You'll see your friends soon.

981
01:14:20,692 --> 01:14:22,986
After they return the treasure

982
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:25,646
I'll send you to
the afterlife together.

983
01:14:27,272 --> 01:14:31,777
Even ninja are helpless
if their hands are bound.

984
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:36,948
<i>Sasuke... Naruto...</i>

985
01:14:38,702 --> 01:14:39,703
Sakura...

986
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:44,416
While we're stuck like this,
Sakura could be...

987
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,968
You idiot, Naruto!

988
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:53,339
Sakura... I'm coming to save you!

989
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:55,427
Wait! You fool!

990
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:02,287
What the hell are
you doing, Sasuke?!

991
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:05,643
Don't you care what happens
to Sakura?!

992
01:15:05,685 --> 01:15:06,895
We will save Sakura!

993
01:15:07,339 --> 01:15:09,508
But we can't do anything if
our hands are like this.

994
01:15:09,945 --> 01:15:13,449
We're going to save her anyway.
It's what friends do!

995
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:21,488
I... I refuse to be the kind of scum
who abandons his friends!

996
01:15:23,202 --> 01:15:27,332
<i>Those who abandon their friends
are worse than scum.</i>

997
01:15:28,163 --> 01:15:31,917
Then meeting up with Kakashi
is the right move!

998
01:15:32,428 --> 01:15:34,346
It will increase Sakura's chance
of survival!

999
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,050
Don't talk about
her chance of survival!

1000
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:39,861
It just depends on how badly
we want to save her!

1001
01:15:41,593 --> 01:15:44,240
We can't let Sakura die
over something this stupid!

1002
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:46,538
You idiot! Stop it, Naruto!

1003
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:54,108
Damn it... Damn it... Damn it...

1004
01:15:55,944 --> 01:16:01,574
You know, a guy who doesn't take
his mission seriously is also trash.

1005
01:16:09,066 --> 01:16:10,067
Gotta pee.

1006
01:16:10,395 --> 01:16:11,396
What?!

1007
01:16:11,671 --> 01:16:14,924
I said, I need to take a leak!

1008
01:16:17,243 --> 01:16:19,188
Hey, what the hell?!

1009
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,002
Uh... well...

1010
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:23,030
Okay, one hand then.

1011
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,940
Cut it out! Not so close!

1012
01:16:24,965 --> 01:16:26,383
What if you spray me too?!

1013
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:29,619
I don't care what you say.
If I gotta go, I gotta go.

1014
01:16:29,644 --> 01:16:30,645
Hold it in!

1015
01:16:30,898 --> 01:16:32,649
Can't.

1016
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:36,784
- Just let me finish, okay? Come on.
- Zip up, you idiot!

1017
01:16:53,835 --> 01:16:55,044
You're in my way, Naruto!

1018
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,506
You're the one who's in my way!

1019
01:16:59,799 --> 01:17:01,634
Give back the treasure!

1020
01:17:08,052 --> 01:17:10,012
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1021
01:17:13,469 --> 01:17:15,096
You can't weave signs with one hand!

1022
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:16,332
Didn't I tell you?

1023
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:18,526
At this rate, we don't have a chance,

1024
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,302
even against guys much
weaker than us!

1025
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,639
Naruto... wait!

1026
01:17:32,665 --> 01:17:34,167
I'm going.

1027
01:17:35,434 --> 01:17:36,435
If you refuse...

1028
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:38,507
I'll cut off my arm, then go.

1029
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:43,337
I'm going to beat this guy
and save Sakura!

1030
01:17:51,197 --> 01:17:52,364
You're so reckless!

1031
01:18:03,302 --> 01:18:06,013
I'm going to save Sakura.

1032
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,544
Since the enemy came this far,

1033
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:11,177
we'll probably be found before
we catch up to Kakashi.

1034
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:12,755
If that's the case,

1035
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:17,159
it's faster to make this guy tell us
where Sakura is and save her ourselves.

1036
01:18:18,012 --> 01:18:19,013
Sasuke...

1037
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,840
Though it'll depend totally
on us working together.

1038
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:25,794
Right!

1039
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,885
Oh, I just remembered.
I gotta pee.

1040
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:40,900
Me too.

1041
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:01,028
What? Suguro hasn't come back?

1042
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,305
I wonder if he...

1043
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:04,748
You're wondering right.

1044
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:05,774
Yeah!

1045
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,959
<i>Sasuke! Naruto!</i>

1046
01:19:13,188 --> 01:19:14,189
Huh?

1047
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:24,861
Free at last.

1048
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:28,479
Only a Feudal Lord's sister
would own a golden statue like this.

1049
01:19:28,925 --> 01:19:31,385
It managed to pull us apart.

1050
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,412
<i>Their hands are free now?</i>

1051
01:19:34,954 --> 01:19:36,664
You can have it

1052
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:39,208
in exchange for our teammate.

1053
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,544
If you don't agree

1054
01:19:42,003 --> 01:19:45,756
I'll pulverize every one of you,
now that my hands are free.

1055
01:19:57,519 --> 01:20:03,316
You don't seriously think a couple of
robbers can beat two ninja, do you?

1056
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:27,048
How come you're gritting
your teeth so hard?

1057
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:32,319
Your veins are popping out
and you're sweating.

1058
01:20:35,781 --> 01:20:36,782
If you're free,

1059
01:20:38,077 --> 01:20:39,662
come over here.

1060
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:42,230
Come on!

1061
01:20:45,858 --> 01:20:48,402
Their hands are still fused!

1062
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,142
There's nothing to fear!

1063
01:20:50,318 --> 01:20:51,360
Get them!

1064
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:55,033
He called our bluff!

1065
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,786
Can't help it!

1066
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:02,197
Why you...

1067
01:21:03,709 --> 01:21:04,710
Wha-?!

1068
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:11,113
- Naruto!
- Right!

1069
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:37,196
Oh no!

1070
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:41,289
Look out, you two!

1071
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:50,423
The treasure is mine!

1072
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,435
We can stop at least one of his hands.

1073
01:22:03,269 --> 01:22:04,437
- Let's go!
- Right!

1074
01:22:29,019 --> 01:22:30,854
Oh no, you don't!

1075
01:22:37,923 --> 01:22:38,590
<i>Fire Style!</i>

1076
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:40,124
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1077
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:43,086
What?! A seal?

1078
01:22:43,934 --> 01:22:49,231
Even if we can weave signs together,
we can't knead chakra.

1079
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:51,723
Why you... Taking me for a fool!

1080
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,487
But we do have a combination attack!

1081
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:55,404
What?!

1082
01:22:55,654 --> 01:22:57,990
Pachinko Jutsu!

1083
01:23:13,964 --> 01:23:16,509
Well, I guess it can be
melted down and re-cast.

1084
01:23:17,051 --> 01:23:18,803
Just maybe.

1085
01:23:19,034 --> 01:23:20,952
Thank you, Sasuke!

1086
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:24,786
Hey, I did my best too.

1087
01:23:25,351 --> 01:23:27,019
This is ridiculous!

1088
01:23:27,186 --> 01:23:29,581
How come you of all people
can't undo this, Kakashi-sensei?!

1089
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,774
Remember, that boss said so too.

1090
01:23:32,358 --> 01:23:35,194
It'll crumble apart in
two or three days.

1091
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:37,905
Like I can put up with him
for that long!

1092
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,703
That's my line.

1093
01:23:43,327 --> 01:23:45,871
Uh-oh... I think I need to go.

1094
01:23:46,163 --> 01:23:47,164
Not again.

1095
01:23:47,415 --> 01:23:51,043
This time, it's a number two.

1096
01:23:51,585 --> 01:23:53,003
You've got to be kidding.

1097
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:55,214
Don't you dare, Naruto!

1098
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:59,885
Aw c'mon, we already peed together.

1099
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:01,929
This is worse!

1100
01:24:06,518 --> 01:24:09,479
<i>"Those who abandon their friends
are worse than scum."</i>

1101
01:24:11,497 --> 01:24:15,125
<i>These three overcome it so easily.</i>

1102
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:43,910
With that being said,
our mission is over.

1103
01:24:44,274 --> 01:24:45,609
You're dismissed.

1104
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:48,762
We're done already?
But it's only ten in the morning!

1105
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:50,866
Lately, all of our missions
have been so boring!

1106
01:24:51,063 --> 01:24:52,857
When are we gonna get
an S-Rank mission?

1107
01:24:52,882 --> 01:24:54,008
"S-Rank"?

1108
01:24:54,982 --> 01:24:56,192
A loser like you?

1109
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:57,468
What are you talking about?

1110
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,884
We're still Genin!

1111
01:24:59,945 --> 01:25:03,032
I want something with
more pizazz... more oomph!

1112
01:25:03,115 --> 01:25:04,283
Uh, there aren't any.

1113
01:25:04,408 --> 01:25:06,285
Okay, dismissed!

1114
01:25:07,995 --> 01:25:10,290
You heard him, Sasuke.

1115
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:11,715
So how about today,
just the two of us...

1116
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,741
I'm going home.

1117
01:25:13,395 --> 01:25:15,022
Just hold on a minute.

1118
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:18,928
There's only one S-rank mission
that we can do.

1119
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:22,218
A mission that's
failed numerous times...

1120
01:25:22,444 --> 01:25:23,862
One that only we can pull off...

1121
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:28,086
... to see what Kakashi-sensei's face
really looks like!

1122
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:32,329
Let's find out our target's
best-kept secret!

1123
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:36,944
Why are you trying to sound like
you know what you're talking about?

1124
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:39,453
Just forget about that already.

1125
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:41,828
Right, Sasuke?

1126
01:25:42,154 --> 01:25:44,657
This is the perfect mission
for a day like today.

1127
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:46,100
I couldn't agree more!

1128
01:25:46,788 --> 01:25:48,997
<i>I got tricked!</i>

1129
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:50,482
<i>Cha!</i>

1130
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:53,958
But what do we do?

1131
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:56,904
It never works out when we try.

1132
01:25:58,212 --> 01:26:00,921
I already have a plan!

1133
01:26:00,946 --> 01:26:01,947
What is it?

1134
01:26:01,972 --> 01:26:02,973
Photos!

1135
01:26:03,364 --> 01:26:06,278
If we go through every single photo
Kakashi-sensei is in,

1136
01:26:06,303 --> 01:26:08,430
there's bound to be at least one...

1137
01:26:09,433 --> 01:26:13,103
I never told you this,
but I already checked once before.

1138
01:26:13,811 --> 01:26:15,521
He has a mask on in every one.

1139
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:19,645
The photo submitted to the Hokage
for the Ninja Registration Form...

1140
01:26:20,796 --> 01:26:23,257
... should be one of him
without a mask.

1141
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:27,937
But it's an extremely classified,
top-secret document...

1142
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:30,896
Accessing it would be no easy task.

1143
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:32,377
Who are you?

1144
01:26:33,245 --> 01:26:35,080
I'm Sukea, a photographer.

1145
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:38,194
I travel east and west
looking for scoops.

1146
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:39,386
What about north and south?

1147
01:26:39,587 --> 01:26:40,629
Naruto!

1148
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:43,407
You've been hung up on the
tiny details this whole time!

1149
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,048
Anyway,
I was searching around for a scoop

1150
01:26:46,073 --> 01:26:48,575
and happened to overhear
an interesting conversation...

1151
01:26:48,731 --> 01:26:51,567
He did hear us!
Should we get rid of him?!

1152
01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:53,035
You idiot!

1153
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:54,409
Ouch!

1154
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:56,037
He's right.

1155
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,839
There's a rule that the photo for
the Ninja Registration Form

1156
01:26:59,864 --> 01:27:01,157
must show your full face.

1157
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,674
It's so obvious, we didn't even
think about looking there.

1158
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:10,045
Will you let me join you
in this adventure?

1159
01:27:10,951 --> 01:27:12,453
What's your motive?

1160
01:27:13,037 --> 01:27:16,498
If I'm able to capture
this Kakashi guy without a mask,

1161
01:27:16,786 --> 01:27:19,956
I'll have the biggest scoop since
the founding of the Hidden Leaf.

1162
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:24,233
Even if it's hushed up, I'm sure to
make a lot of money out of this.

1163
01:27:24,518 --> 01:27:25,816
Hey! Hey!

1164
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:28,844
When you get the money, you have to
treat us to ramen! Promise?

1165
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,329
I'll even throw in some dumplings.

1166
01:27:30,427 --> 01:27:31,595
So it's settled then?

1167
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:34,892
This is getting interesting...

1168
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:38,141
Oh, you guys...

1169
01:27:39,142 --> 01:27:42,104
<i>I'm getting kind of
excited for this!</i>

1170
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:53,375
Secret documents are stored here...

1171
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:55,938
This is an infiltration mission...

1172
01:27:56,622 --> 01:27:59,667
Sukea, will you be able to keep up?

1173
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:05,274
Before I started taking pictures,
I was just a rank-and-file ninja myself...

1174
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,516
All right! Let's begin the mission!

1175
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:26,193
Not done yet, Sasuke?!

1176
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,553
Shut up... Wait!

1177
01:28:28,299 --> 01:28:30,051
Can we switch?

1178
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:41,041
It opened! Wow!

1179
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,067
Sukea...

1180
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,878
What division did you belong to?

1181
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,743
The Intel Unit. We reported
directly to Lord Hokage.

1182
01:28:49,675 --> 01:28:50,676
That's the...

1183
01:28:51,135 --> 01:28:52,387
ANBU Black Ops.

1184
01:28:53,971 --> 01:28:56,473
Things happened
and now I'm retired.

1185
01:28:56,845 --> 01:29:00,223
Considering your past,
is it wise for you to be doing this?

1186
01:29:01,106 --> 01:29:03,108
You'll be targeted by the ANBU.

1187
01:29:03,689 --> 01:29:06,984
Don't worry about it.
C'mon, let's go.

1188
01:29:12,756 --> 01:29:14,842
We have to search in all of these?

1189
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:15,868
Let's hurry.

1190
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:31,143
Found it! This is it!

1191
01:29:35,297 --> 01:29:36,744
Okay, let's open it.

1192
01:29:40,573 --> 01:29:42,950
The moment is finally here!

1193
01:29:56,578 --> 01:29:57,579
Don't move!

1194
01:29:59,845 --> 01:30:01,430
We're taking you in.

1195
01:30:02,195 --> 01:30:04,504
Make a move and
we'll take that as resistance...

1196
01:30:04,884 --> 01:30:06,570
If necessary, we will take you down.

1197
01:30:06,694 --> 01:30:09,201
I-I feel like I'm going to sneeze.

1198
01:30:09,226 --> 01:30:10,675
Idiot! Hold it in!

1199
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,993
Damn it... we were so close!

1200
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:30,609
Really? An infiltration mission?

1201
01:30:30,905 --> 01:30:35,201
I'm so sorry... I tried to stop them,
but they insisted...

1202
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:36,318
Huh?! What a jerk!

1203
01:30:36,343 --> 01:30:39,388
So you planned on blaming us
from the start if this failed?!

1204
01:30:40,345 --> 01:30:43,056
They wanted to see
what you really looked like...

1205
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:45,978
You're a former ANBU Black Ops,
aren't you?

1206
01:30:46,003 --> 01:30:51,551
Honestly! Who cares what
my face looks like, anyway?!

1207
01:30:58,637 --> 01:31:01,306
You've got some nerve blaming us!

1208
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:03,000
I thought it was strange.

1209
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:05,943
You're skilled,
and you're a former ANBU.

1210
01:31:06,206 --> 01:31:07,916
You could've done this alone.

1211
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:11,693
I just can't stand handsome guys
who do nasty things.

1212
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:13,491
Sorry! Sorry!

1213
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:17,197
I'll make it up to you by helping you
photograph Kakashi-sensei's face.

1214
01:31:17,584 --> 01:31:19,294
This time, I'll use
my photography skills.

1215
01:31:19,533 --> 01:31:21,326
What? You're still gonna do this?

1216
01:31:21,672 --> 01:31:24,216
You're giving up already?

1217
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:26,541
What's your plan?

1218
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:28,615
Let's go after Kakashi himself.

1219
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:31,585
We'll lure him out to a meal,
then photograph him while he eats.

1220
01:31:32,129 --> 01:31:35,966
We tried so many times and failed.

1221
01:31:37,032 --> 01:31:40,994
Every time, at the very moment
we have a chance to see his face,

1222
01:31:41,019 --> 01:31:42,520
we get interrupted.

1223
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:45,749
With this multi-exposure
camera I built,

1224
01:31:45,821 --> 01:31:47,656
we're bound to get
at least one good photo.

1225
01:31:52,282 --> 01:31:56,829
Sensei! I need to talk to you about
something really important!

1226
01:31:57,769 --> 01:31:58,770
What is it?

1227
01:31:59,757 --> 01:32:02,635
Well, why don't we eat
some dumplings while we talk?

1228
01:32:03,738 --> 01:32:05,574
I'm ready!

1229
01:32:06,624 --> 01:32:09,251
All right, I'm gonna
take you up on your offer!

1230
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:33,587
Hey, Naruto!

1231
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:35,520
Were you guys
out taking a stroll too?

1232
01:32:36,972 --> 01:32:40,434
Don't bother us! We're doing
something really important!

1233
01:32:40,459 --> 01:32:41,460
What is it?

1234
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:47,649
I'm about to find out.

1235
01:32:48,951 --> 01:32:50,161
<i>He already ate it?!</i>

1236
01:32:52,593 --> 01:32:55,345
<i>But this time,
we got you on camera!</i>

1237
01:33:10,402 --> 01:33:12,321
This is... impossible...

1238
01:33:13,229 --> 01:33:15,315
You're kidding...
Not a single one?

1239
01:33:15,845 --> 01:33:18,681
I feel like some divine power
is at work here.

1240
01:33:20,496 --> 01:33:22,456
I guess this means...

1241
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:27,599
The mission's over
and we're dismissed, huh?

1242
01:33:36,345 --> 01:33:38,013
I guess I'll be...

1243
01:33:38,514 --> 01:33:39,681
Hey, Naruto!

1244
01:33:44,668 --> 01:33:46,711
What are you guys up to?

1245
01:33:47,659 --> 01:33:49,661
Kiba...
And everyone else!

1246
01:34:03,945 --> 01:34:05,077
Kakashi-sensei!

1247
01:34:06,572 --> 01:34:08,062
P-Perfect timing!

1248
01:34:08,087 --> 01:34:10,479
U-Um...
O-Over there...

1249
01:34:10,504 --> 01:34:12,673
What's wrong?
Calm down and tell me.

1250
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:17,794
A woman has drowned...
O-Over there by the river...

1251
01:34:18,106 --> 01:34:19,107
What?!

1252
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:41,618
This isn't good.
Her pulse is weak.

1253
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:43,747
<i>Good job, Sakura!</i>

1254
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:48,091
<i>Her medicine's even fooled
Kakashi-sensei!</i>

1255
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,232
This calls for...

1256
01:34:55,662 --> 01:34:58,623
<i>He definitely has to
take his mask off now!</i>

1257
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,538
This woman's in danger!
We can't waste any time!

1258
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:11,670
We have to get her to the hospital!

1259
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,682
Plan A... failed.

1260
01:35:19,058 --> 01:35:22,353
<i>Understood.
Everyone, switch to Plan B.</i>

1261
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,725
<i>Mr. Sukea, please get into
position as well.</i>

1262
01:35:25,084 --> 01:35:26,085
Roger.

1263
01:35:31,762 --> 01:35:33,722
All right, he's coming!

1264
01:35:34,277 --> 01:35:35,612
Just as Shikamaru predicted,

1265
01:35:35,844 --> 01:35:38,096
he's gonna pass this way
to get to the hospital.

1266
01:35:38,328 --> 01:35:39,704
Everyone get in position!

1267
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,080
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1268
01:35:49,839 --> 01:35:54,594
<i>Human Boulder!</i>
Roll! Roll! Roll!

1269
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:06,437
What are you doing?!
We have to get her to...

1270
01:36:12,909 --> 01:36:13,910
Go!

1271
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:15,754
<i>Hidden Jutsu: Beetle Sphere!</i>

1272
01:36:19,249 --> 01:36:20,250
Now!

1273
01:36:24,087 --> 01:36:26,856
<i>3... 2... 1</i>

1274
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:27,673
Now!

1275
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:28,717
Scatter!

1276
01:36:30,462 --> 01:36:32,047
<i>Mind Transfer Jutsu!</i>

1277
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:44,869
Look, you guys...

1278
01:36:45,165 --> 01:36:46,650
I get that you want to see
what I look like,

1279
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:48,069
but think about the situation
we're in!

1280
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,763
She needs to get to
the hospital ASAP!

1281
01:36:58,025 --> 01:36:59,568
<i>Shadow Possession Jutsu!</i>

1282
01:36:59,686 --> 01:37:00,687
Success!

1283
01:37:08,423 --> 01:37:10,592
Do it now, Sukea!

1284
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:16,765
It finally worked, Naruto.

1285
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:19,935
You can have ramen
and dumplings now!

1286
01:37:22,663 --> 01:37:25,124
Hey guys, the plan worked!

1287
01:37:26,783 --> 01:37:27,993
Finally...

1288
01:37:28,018 --> 01:37:30,353
You guys should all be
grateful to us.

1289
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:31,288
That's because...

1290
01:37:31,313 --> 01:37:34,066
Okay, Kakashi-sensei...
Get ready!

1291
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,591
Do it, Shikamaru!

1292
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,542
It's time for the unveiling.

1293
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:39,609
Wait, wait, you guys.

1294
01:37:40,026 --> 01:37:42,611
Let's just talk things over.

1295
01:37:44,631 --> 01:37:47,551
H-Hey!
Stop! Stop!

1296
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:52,230
C-Calm down!

1297
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:56,763
Keeping this a mystery makes it
more alluring, don't you think?

1298
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:02,342
Ramen and dumplings at Ichiraku
sound way more alluring to me.

1299
01:38:03,578 --> 01:38:04,787
So you were bribed!

1300
01:38:06,078 --> 01:38:07,245
Checkmate!

1301
01:38:07,772 --> 01:38:11,109
Hey! Wait!
I mean, please wait!

1302
01:38:20,745 --> 01:38:22,080
You're being annoying, Lee!

1303
01:38:22,747 --> 01:38:24,305
Please spar with me!

1304
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:25,331
Neji!

1305
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:28,169
What?
Don't interfere!

1306
01:38:28,753 --> 01:38:32,364
Enough is enough, you two!

1307
01:38:42,267 --> 01:38:44,270
Hey! Wait!

1308
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:50,940
Sorry!

1309
01:38:57,103 --> 01:38:58,521
Ouch!

1310
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:07,377
A... a Shadow Clone?

1311
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:09,210
What the hell is going on?

1312
01:39:09,336 --> 01:39:12,464
Does this mean Kakashi-sensei was
on to us from the very beginning?

1313
01:39:22,766 --> 01:39:25,727
That was too bad... But I'm really
grateful to all of you.

1314
01:39:26,615 --> 01:39:31,036
Nah... Thanks to you, Sukea,
we had a great time!

1315
01:39:31,730 --> 01:39:32,581
Thank you!

1316
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:34,636
I'd better get going.

1317
01:39:35,378 --> 01:39:37,547
Let's team up again
if something comes up.

1318
01:39:38,727 --> 01:39:41,362
Hope you get your scoop!

1319
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,809
<i>They really seem like
they're having fun!</i>

1320
01:40:08,144 --> 01:40:11,773
It was sheer coincidence that Kiba
came to the dumpling shop...

1321
01:40:12,014 --> 01:40:14,767
But who would have thought
everyone would team up.

1322
01:40:15,071 --> 01:40:18,867
But something like this is nice
once in a while.

1323
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:21,157
But it really wears me out...

1324
01:40:22,402 --> 01:40:25,905
... using this many Clones
and Transformations.

1325
01:40:26,996 --> 01:40:30,917
It was a close call with my mask...
because of everyone's teamwork.

1326
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,056
Even if they'd gotten the mask off,
it wouldn't have mattered.

1327
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,584
Because I'm wearing
a backup mask underneath.

1328
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:45,517
Food is the best way!

1329
01:40:45,542 --> 01:40:47,836
That has the highest probability...

1330
01:40:48,127 --> 01:40:52,756
But the problem is how to get
Kakashi-sensei to eat with us.

1331
01:40:53,368 --> 01:40:54,786
Bad timing!
They're coming this way!

1332
01:41:19,752 --> 01:41:20,633
Hey!

1333
01:41:24,906 --> 01:41:25,889
Excuse me,

1334
01:41:26,014 --> 01:41:28,683
but did you notice
any trouble around here?

1335
01:41:28,828 --> 01:41:32,187
Huh?
No, there wasn't anything like that...

1336
01:41:43,001 --> 01:41:44,332
Kakashi...

1337
01:41:45,571 --> 01:41:48,866
I heard him and his team were making
a commotion all around town.

1338
01:41:50,063 --> 01:41:52,965
Sorry for stopping you.

1339
01:41:53,396 --> 01:41:54,605
N-No problem.

1340
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,180
Hey.

1341
01:42:09,567 --> 01:42:12,653
Uh, can I help you?

1342
01:42:13,228 --> 01:42:16,022
Don't I know you from somewhere?

1343
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:19,852
N-No...
I don't think so...

1344
01:42:21,294 --> 01:42:24,624
Really?
Well, excuse me then. Later!

1345
01:42:29,035 --> 01:42:30,662
I could have sworn
I've met him before...

1346
01:43:18,493 --> 01:43:21,955
Changing my voice
really puts a strain on the throat.

1347
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:42,711
It turned out to be
a good mission after all...

1348
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:46,629
Their teamwork is
much better than it was

1349
01:43:46,654 --> 01:43:48,239
during the bell test.

1350
01:43:49,281 --> 01:43:50,282
Oh well...

1351
01:43:50,366 --> 01:43:53,453
I can probably only pull this off
two or three more times...
