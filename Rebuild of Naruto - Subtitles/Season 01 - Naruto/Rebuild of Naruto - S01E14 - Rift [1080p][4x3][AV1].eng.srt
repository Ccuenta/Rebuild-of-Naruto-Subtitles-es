1
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,902
What do you think you're doing
with Grandpa's things?!

2
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,685
Honorable Grandson...

3
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,089
Those belong to my Grandpa!

4
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,124
Where are you taking them?!

5
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,901
Uh... you mean these?

6
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,737
They are no longer used,

7
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:55,394
so I was moving them
into a storage elsewhere.

8
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,034
No longer used, you say...

9
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,863
You think it's okay to take Grandpa's
things away without permission?!

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,208
The Fifth Hokage will be using
this office, you see.

11
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,085
The Fifth Hokage?

12
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,254
Y-Yes.

13
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,465
The next Hokage
has finally been decided.

14
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,093
The village can have peace of mind now.

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,347
That person apparently
doesn't smoke tobacco...

16
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,064
What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,977
It's too soon for that!

18
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,188
When you all relied on
the Old Man until just recently!

19
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:04,058
There are seven birds within 50 meters
behind me at 2 o'clock.

20
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,563
Tenten...?

21
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,591
Neji!

22
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,946
I just heard that Lady Tsunade
has returned!

23
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,039
It's really her.
Wanna go see her?

24
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:22,853
Sorry.

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,913
But I'm not interested.

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,539
Huh?

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,709
<i>So there were...</i>

28
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:31,872
<i>eight birds, huh...</i>

29
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,589
Listen carefully, Tsunade.

30
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,758
We must call the feudal lords

31
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:40,269
and announce that
the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.

32
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:45,099
We will start preparations today
for the inauguration ceremony in the village.

33
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,020
Feudal lords and ceremonies
are just a big pain.

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,239
Tsunade!

35
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,277
Yes, yes, I know...
This is part of the Hokage's job, too.

36
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,321
- Genma!
- Here!

37
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,822
- Aoba!
- Here!

38
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,329
Issue an official notice and

39
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,219
inform the village
within the next few days.

40
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,290
We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.

41
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,959
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

42
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,128
Gimme a break,
my shoulders are so stiff.

43
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:19,243
I wish I could just down
a nice cup of hot sake and relax.

44
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,235
Lady Tsunade!

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,636
Wait a second!

46
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,012
Before you do that,

47
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:25,473
you have something else you need to do,
Old Lady Tsunade!

48
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,809
What was it?

49
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,786
I told you, didn't I?!

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,730
About Kakashi-sensei and
Sasuke and Bushy Brow!

51
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,149
Oh... right, right.

52
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,902
Hey, if it isn't Naruto!

53
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,446
Huh? Shikamaru?

54
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,491
Why are you in a place like this?

55
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,826
That's my question-

56
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,911
Why are you in a place like this?

57
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,126
I have no idea why,

58
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,071
but my father told me
to come along with him.

59
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,626
What's up with that?

60
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,587
Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.

61
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,340
Oh, the kid from the Nara clan, huh...?

62
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,589
Are you taking proper care
of the deer?

63
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,887
The antlers of the deer from
that area make very good medicine.

64
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,654
Yes, I'm somehow managing.

65
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,992
Hey, Naruto, who's that person

66
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,269
who acts like such
a big shot when she's so young?

67
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,438
That's apparently the new Hokage.

68
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,314
Huh?!

69
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,315
Despite her appearance,
she's an old lady in her fifties.

70
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,152
Ehh?!

71
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,529
Well, see you again sometime.

72
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,697
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,826
All right, to the hospital!

74
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
See you later, Shikamaru.

75
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,496
I'll show you an awesome
new technique I learned!

76
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,187
That's the new Fifth Hokage...?

77
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,543
Hey, Shikamaru.

78
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,757
That person is the strongest
and most beautiful person in the world.

79
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:41,883
Huh?

80
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,822
I mean, she's the only woman
among the Legendary Sannin.

81
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,266
Huh... A woman Hokage!?

82
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,395
I'm not very comfortable with women...

83
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:55,897
Huh?

84
00:05:56,269 --> 00:06:00,107
They're pushy, they meddle in everything,

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,030
and you can never tell what
they're really thinking.

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,160
They always think they can make
men do whatever they want.

87
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,038
Anyway, they're just a drag.

88
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,249
Hey Shikamaru...

89
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,818
Without women,
men wouldn't be born.

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,926
If women weren't around,
nothing good would come of men.

91
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,012
No matter how tough
a woman might be,

92
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,045
she'll show her gentle side
to the man she loves.

93
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,852
<i>I can't believe Dad's saying that...</i>

94
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,938
<i>when he's so completely whipped by Mom.</i>

95
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,609
You'll understand once
you reach that age.

96
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh no!

97
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,239
Let's hurry up and
get our business done...

98
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,450
because Mom will chew us out
if we're late.

99
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,661
Hurry up, Shikamaru!

100
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:01,918
I'm coming in.

101
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,235
Who are you...?

102
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,117
<i>What a beautiful woman...</i>

103
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,683
Sakura, Sakura!

104
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:15,346
Everything will be all right now!

105
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:17,282
I brought along an awesome person.

106
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,149
Sasuke will be fine now!

107
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,693
Naruto...

108
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,741
<i>Those two flowers aren't from
the same day.</i>

109
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,870
<i>So this kid is coming here
every day, huh...</i>

110
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,415
I heard from Guy-sensei...

111
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,209
Please save Sasuke.

112
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,212
Okay, leave it to me.

113
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,668
Sasuke!

114
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,128
Sasuke...

115
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,765
Sasuke!

116
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,684
Sasuke, you...!

117
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,758
<i>Hmm, despite his appearance,
Naruto is pretty considerate.</i>

118
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,093
Huh?

119
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,669
Next! Next!

120
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,729
How disgraceful!

121
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,187
To be taken down by
just two rogue ninja.

122
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,125
And here I thought you were a genius.

123
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,986
I'm sorry...

124
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,502
All right! Kakashi-sensei's done!

125
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,127
Next, Bushy Brow!

126
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,910
Please, hurry and examine my disciple, Lee!

127
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,123
Lee!

128
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,085
I brought Lady Tsunade here!

129
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,186
That's your disciple?

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,852
Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!

131
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,021
I see...

132
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,160
Naruto.

133
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:09,013
Huh?

134
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,028
Should you really be wasting time here?

135
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,546
Uh, I almost forgot!

136
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,403
I had an appointment to
meet Iruka-sensei!

137
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:17,842
Go on!

138
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,536
Okay! I'll leave the rest in your hands!

139
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:21,474
All right!

140
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,810
Hey, Naruto!

141
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,712
You're late, Iruka-sensei!

142
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,147
Sorry, sorry.

143
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:33,976
There were lots of things to do
regarding the Fifth Hokage.

144
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,835
I guess...

145
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:42,742
I'll be straight with you.

146
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,311
Give up on being a shinobi.

147
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,946
L-Lady Tsunade...
don't joke like that.

148
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,369
There are numerous bone fragments
in the area around important nerves.

149
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,046
Moreover, they are deeply embedded.

150
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,043
Physically, you can no longer
function as a shinobi.

151
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,798
Come now, Lady Tsunade,
don't joke like that...

152
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,008
Even if I were to operate...

153
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,890
Don't be fooled, Lee!

154
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,096
That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!

155
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,015
You've used the Transformation Jutsu,
you evil woman!

156
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,976
Who the heck are you?!

157
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,077
Don't I have any... chance?

158
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,275
There is no one besides me
who is capable of doing the surgery

159
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,117
and it would take too much time.

160
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,086
Furthermore, there is a huge risk...

161
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,879
Risk?

162
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,300
The probability of
a successful surgery is 50% at best,

163
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,386
and if it fails...

164
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,347
You'll die.

165
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,111
<i>Guy-sensei!</i>

166
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,448
<i>I'm not at all ready
to throw in the towel!</i>

167
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,413
<i>Guy-sensei, what's this god awful
bitter rice dumpling?</i>

168
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,083
<i>They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.</i>

169
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,086
<i>If you eat one hundred of them,
they should heal your wound.</i>

170
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>I see, if I don't eat
one hundred of them,</i>

171
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,632
<i>my wound won't heal, right?</i>

172
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,181
<i>N-Not in a single day!</i>

173
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,727
It's better for you to give up
on being a shinobi and find another path.

174
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,438
Lee...

175
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,424
If I knew this would happen,
I never should have brought you here.

176
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:21,948
Don't say that...!

177
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,015
I know how painful this is for you,
but it's better to be direct.

178
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,352
Because it's something he'll have
to understand sooner or later.

179
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,689
The longer we wait...

180
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,014
the harder it will be for him.

181
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,053
<i>I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid ninja</i>

182
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>even though I can't
use ninjutsu or genjutsu!</i>

183
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,925
<i>That would be the ultimate for me!</i>

184
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,566
At this rate,
we will have to open it by force.

185
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,027
Try it! Who do you think I am?!

186
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,488
I am the grandson of
the Third Hokage!

187
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,620
If you go against me, then...

188
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,414
It means you're going
against the Hokage!

189
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,585
We need Lady Tsunade
to assume her position immediately.

190
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,642
Those are pepper smoke bombs!

191
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,020
You'll get something worse
if you come any closer!

192
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,106
Honorable Grandson! Even for you...

193
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,778
There are things that can
and cannot be forgiven!

194
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,821
Shut up!

195
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,283
What is all this commotion
so early in the morning?

196
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,370
It's hurting my head.

197
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,413
Lady Tsunade...

198
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,972
Just one kid...
What are you all doing?

199
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:22,940
Yes...

200
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:25,228
Get rid of him!

201
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,889
But it's the grandson
of the Third Hokage!

202
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,458
It doesn't matter if
he's the grandson or the great-grandson.

203
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,769
I am the granddaughter
of the First Hokage!

204
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,733
A good thrashing might knock
some sense into him.

205
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,068
Now move it!

206
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,986
- Yes!
- Yes!

207
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,786
Wait!

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,866
Naruto?!

209
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,870
Hey, hold on there.

210
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,705
I don't really know what's going on,

211
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,834
but don't be so rough with Konohamaru,
Granny Tsunade.

212
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,294
An acquaintance of yours?

213
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:04,012
Yes, yes...

214
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,259
I'll do the convincing, leave it to me.

215
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,583
Then get this settled by the end of the day!

216
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,475
Oh, Lady Tsunade... Please wait!

217
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:26,239
I would think that at least
one bar would be open.

218
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:30,514
There's no way.
What time do you think it is right now?

219
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,617
I can't drink sake, and I can't gamble.

220
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,746
The Hidden Leaf Village...
This place is no fun at all.

221
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,256
This place is just like the Third Hokage.

222
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,458
Lady Tsunade!

223
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,003
Oh, I'm tired.

224
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:48,377
I just want to sit down and
have a drink somewhere.

225
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,444
I understand.

226
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:57,658
I'll take you to a place where
you can sit and have a drink.

227
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,638
What?

228
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,878
But I will have you do your work!

229
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,487
Eight D-rank missions,
three C-rank missions...

230
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,741
I see, very much like Team Kurenai.

231
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,371
We can easily figure out
what the Third Hokage was thinking.

232
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,045
This is the same as
their parents' team.

233
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,776
I see.

234
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:38,140
Oh, I see. This team has its
own specialty and is well-balanced.

235
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,869
My shoulders are stiff.

236
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,871
I'm going to go get
some fresh air outside.

237
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,815
Success...

238
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:34,510
Success...

239
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,101
Oh, now I'm mad!

240
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:54,633
I could bust down a door or two
with this new technique of mine!

241
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,135
- Naruto!
- Naruto!

242
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,876
Granny Tsunade...

243
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:01,849
Oh! Watch out!

244
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,780
W-Wow...

245
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:08,564
<i>I can't believe that I let
Lady Tsunade out of my sight!</i>

246
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,276
Did you find her, Tonton?

247
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,862
Cell Revitalization, I see.

248
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,492
I've found you, Lady Tsunade.

249
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,411
What?

250
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,159
Lady Tsunade is studying

251
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,933
Be quiet! I can't concentrate.

252
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,925
Concentrate?!

253
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,928
I've never heard you use that word
except when you're gambling.

254
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,223
Is that Shizune's voice?

255
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,127
Shizune...

256
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,227
Do you remember that medical ninja
by the name of Kabuto?

257
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:16,237
What about him?

258
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:20,054
His cell regeneration technique.

259
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:23,480
I was researching ways to apply
that technique to patients.

260
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,338
For Lee?

261
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:33,208
If I can raise that 50% chance to 51%,
it's worth trying.

262
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,458
It really depends on
the individual's traits.

263
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,466
Even for you, mastering that technique
would probably be difficult.

264
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,755
I'll just have to try.

265
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,184
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

266
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,049
<i>It can't be helped, Konohamaru.</i>

267
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,301
<i>I am the Third Hokage, after all.</i>

268
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>If you don't like it,
you should just quit!</i>

269
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>Everybody from the village
is my family.</i>

270
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,544
<i>To protect the family,
that is the duty of a Hokage.</i>

271
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,840
<i>Oh! Old Man!</i>

272
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,191
Just for today,
I'm making a special exception.

273
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,572
What's the matter, Konohamaru?

274
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,116
Don't you want to see
Old Lady Tsunade?

275
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,201
No.

276
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,214
<i>I'll just have to do it.
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.</i>

277
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:07,975
<i>It can't be helped, Konohamaru.
I am the Third Hokage, after all.</i>

278
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:13,705
I guess it can't be helped.
I'm the Honorable Grandson, after all.

279
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:14,976
Huh?

280
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,164
I am Konohamaru of the Hidden Leaf Village,
after all!

281
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,692
H-Hey, Konohamaru, wait!

282
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,988
What's going on with him?
Hey, Konohamaru!

283
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,329
Lady Tsunade?

284
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,497
Nothing...

285
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

286
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,942
<i>Transformation Jutsu!</i>

287
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,241
Hey, young kid...

288
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,457
Youth is about passion
and never looking back!

289
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,375
Listen, if you give it your all,

290
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:24,549
you will become a splendid shinobi!
Yay!

291
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,218
<i>Who is he?
He is pretty overbearing.</i>

292
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,015
Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth...

293
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,976
Well then, farewell.

294
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:44,217
Here you are.

295
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,694
Guy-sensei?

296
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,889
How did you know I was here?

297
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,373
I know everything about you.

298
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,841
I heard you skipped rehabilitation
these past two days?

299
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:01,128
You can't be doing that!

300
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,636
When I first became a Genin...

301
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:17,242
this is where I revealed
my dream, my aspiration.

302
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:26,296
Neji laughed at me then,
but I meant what I said.

303
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,681
<i>I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid ninja</i>

304
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,946
<i>even though I can't use
ninjutsu or genjutsu!</i>

305
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,827
<i>That would be the ultimate for me!</i>

306
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,586
At that time, you told me...

307
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:44,353
If you act with passion,
compete with rivals,

308
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,338
you can become a fine ninja.

309
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,589
And that...

310
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,985
In order to do that, it'd take "effort."

311
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,512
I was happy to hear that.

312
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,306
- <i>Transform!</i>
- <i>Transform!</i>

313
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,143
Because while at the academy...

314
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,857
no one, not one friend or teacher,
said that kind of thing to me.

315
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,534
You put me at ease...

316
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,455
You opened up a path
just when I was unsure of myself.

317
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,334
I realized all I had to do
was try my best.

318
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,551
And when I complained that

319
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:43,746
all my efforts couldn't match
the others' natural talents,

320
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:47,635
you told me that I had
a natural talent for effort.

321
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:53,528
That was when I learned the importance
of believing in my own strength.

322
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:03,330
<i>The chance of a successful surgery
is probably 50%, at best.</i>

323
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,257
But... this is one time...
even if I try my best...!

324
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:19,078
And even if I believe in myself,
there's nothing in the world I can do!

325
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,060
Guy-sensei... Please tell me...!

326
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,859
<i>Please tell me.
Can I become like you?</i>

327
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,696
Why did this kind of thing
happen only to me?

328
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,536
<i>Because I have my own
Ninja Way to follow.</i>

329
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:42,010
<i>I have my own dreams I have to protect,</i>

330
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>and I will prove them,
even if it means dying!</i>

331
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:47,337
What should I do?!

332
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,376
<i>The Eight Inner Gates...</i>

333
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,504
<i>The Forbidden Jutsu that destroys
the user's body?</i>

334
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,798
Please tell me!

335
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,343
<i>I'm prepared for the worst.</i>

336
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!</i>

337
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,388
<i>Everything is... for my dream!</i>

338
00:28:04,513 --> 00:28:07,637
<i>That means everything to me!</i>

339
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,408
The time is right...

340
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,811
Head for the Leaf Village, now!

341
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:42,772
But thank goodness
your injury wasn't serious.

342
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:46,185
Naruto was relieved, too...

343
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:55,218
Sasuke, you must be hungry.
Is there something you want to eat?

344
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,571
I'll go buy something for you.

345
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,202
To be honest,
I really don't understand.

346
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,723
It seems there were opinions that,

347
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,193
with the final round of the exams being suspended,

348
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:16,097
no one should pass this time around.

349
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:22,171
But I hear the late Third Hokage
highly praised your match.

350
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:25,594
It seems he intended to recommend you
for Chunin.

351
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,337
The lords of other lands
who observed the fight

352
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,586
and the proctors were of
the same opinion as well...

353
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:35,663
In that case, it's not my place to object.

354
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:37,468
From now on,

355
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:40,912
strive to perform in a manner
that is worthy of that headband...

356
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:45,007
Congratulations!
As of today, you're a Chunin!

357
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,313
- Wow...
- Wow!

358
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,803
Even someone as lazy as you
looks respectable for once.

359
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,242
It doesn't suit you.

360
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:58,571
Hey, don't laugh...

361
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,398
For the time being,

362
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,885
let's have a toast to celebrate
Shikamaru's promotion to Chunin!

363
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:06,134
Let's eat!

364
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:08,344
Oh! Choji!

365
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,105
Don't eat the meat before the toast!

366
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,562
But, it'd be a waste if it got burned, so...

367
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,207
There's a lot of meat. Eat up!

368
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:18,686
All right!

369
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,692
You'll end up in the hospital again, Choji.

370
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:30,219
Don't you know how to savor the taste?

371
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:31,611
Never mind!

372
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:35,370
Even if I eat a lot,
I know how to savor properly.

373
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:44,252
Hey! Choji, that's the last piece of meat
that I've been grilling!

374
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,802
The last bite!

375
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:47,682
This is the conclusion and

376
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:51,127
will become the meat with
the greatest value that should be savored!

377
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,937
I won't hand over
this last bite to anyone!

378
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,150
What are you acting cool for,
you idiot?!

379
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,821
Everyone makes fun of you
because you're like this!

380
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,762
- You're just a fat-
- Ino!

381
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,533
That's a taboo word!

382
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:10,458
But really, Choji...

383
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,705
A meal isn't a battle.

384
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:15,747
You need to relax sometimes.
What a drag.

385
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,219
<i>Foul-mouthed... Gluttonous...
Too lazy...</i>

386
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,512
<i>I wonder if these guys
will be okay from now on.</i>

387
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:30,141
<i>In particular...</i>

388
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,560
Choji. With you, it's nothing but food.

389
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,572
Do a little training sometime!

390
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:31,834
<i>Right now,
I have no interest in you...</i>

391
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:35,978
<i>So your target is Naruto, after all.</i>

392
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,782
Hey, Sakura!

393
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,009
<i>Naruto!</i>

394
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,646
It's a tranquil village as always...

395
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,898
The security sucks.

396
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,066
Humph!

397
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:10,378
We should just slaughter everyone
in this pathetic village.

398
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,407
Calm down, Sakon.

399
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:15,289
We haven't come here to fight.

400
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:17,375
Shut up, you coward.

401
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:18,683
If you're scared,

402
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,377
you should just go home
and go to bed already.

403
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,126
I'm telling you to calm down, Tayuya.

404
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,504
You understand what
our job is this time, right?

405
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,052
I got some apples...
You like them, right?

406
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,252
Here, doesn't it look good?

407
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,977
Huh...? I wonder where I put the knife...

408
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:43,594
It's right there in front of you.

409
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:48,651
It's so lame, you're getting all scatterbrained
just because you're in front of Sasuke.

410
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:49,927
I'd take "lame" from anyone but you...

411
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:50,907
<i>Naruto...</i>

412
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,032
<i>U-zu-ma-ki!</i>

413
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,534
<i>Naruto 2K Barrage!</i>

414
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,041
Knock it off already!

415
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,800
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

416
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,664
<i>I will... protect Sakura!</i>

417
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,508
I-I give up...

418
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,203
<i>Sasuke... Thank you.</i>

419
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,557
<i>You rescued me from
those Sand shinobi, right?</i>

420
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,641
<i>No...</i>

421
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,896
<i>The person who rescued you...
was Naruto.</i>

422
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,209
<i>You are weak.</i>

423
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,423
<i>Why are you weak...?</i>

424
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>It's because you don't have enough...</i>

425
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,095
<i>... hate.</i>

426
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,473
Good. I peeled it nicely.

427
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,975
I'll cut it to make it easy to eat, and...

428
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,853
Here, Sasuke.

429
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,983
Ow! What happened?

430
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:12,884
S-Sasuke?

431
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,695
Huh? What's going on?

432
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,828
Hey, Naruto...

433
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,579
What is it?

434
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,457
Fight me... Right now!

435
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,921
What?!
Granny Tsunade just finished treating you!

436
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,422
What are you saying?

437
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,007
Just fight!

438
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,428
<i>Sasuke...</i>

439
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,722
You think you saved me?

440
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,392
I don't care if she's the Fifth Hokage
or whatever, but...

441
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,090
she should've just minded
her own business!

442
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,353
What?!

443
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,752
You said you wanted to fight me, right?

444
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:54,983
I'm saying let's do it now!

445
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,197
Or have you chickened out?

446
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:03,435
S-Sasuke. Hey...
What's going on?!

447
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,788
Naruto, you say something too!

448
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,623
What's this all of a sudden?

449
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,253
This is perfect!

450
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,339
I was just thinking
I wanted to fight you!

451
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:18,782
Come with me!

452
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,560
<i>What's... this feeling?
My stomach's all tingly...</i>

453
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,605
<i>I want to fight you, too.</i>

454
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,276
<i>And... I feel a thrill.</i>

455
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,990
What's so funny?

456
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:26,518
Nothing's funny! I'm just happy!

457
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:30,903
Because I'm thinking
I can finally beat you here!

458
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,587
What was that? Don't get cocky, you loser!

459
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,508
I'm not going to be
a failure forever!

460
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:47,098
<i>Right now,
I have no interest in you...</i>

461
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:55,940
You... A loser like you shouldn't be
acting all high and mighty!

462
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:59,591
Hah! It's unlike you to lose
your cool and raise a fuss.

463
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,945
So uncharacteristic.

464
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,950
It couldn't be that you picked a fight
and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?

465
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,618
Just bring it, now!

466
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,955
Put on your headband before that!
I'll wait.

467
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,124
I don't need such a thing...

468
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,875
Just do it!

469
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:22,133
You couldn't even put a scratch on my forehead!

470
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:23,671
You're wrong!

471
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,806
This is the symbol of our fight as equals,
as shinobi of the Leaf!

472
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,102
And I'm saying stuff like that
is acting high and mighty!

473
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,730
Do you think that we're equal?!

474
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:41,319
Yeah, I do! I've never once
thought that I'm inferior to you!

475
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,487
You're an eyesore!

476
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,409
That's because you're still weak,
little Sasuke!

477
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,411
Naruto!

478
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,288
Sasuke!

479
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,733
Don't be getting carried away!

480
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,159
That's enough!

481
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,005
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

482
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,287
<i>U-zu-ma-ki!</i>

483
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,794
<i>Naruto Barrage!</i>

484
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,589
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

485
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,226
N-Naruto!

486
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,615
W-What is that jutsu?!

487
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:57,913
<i>Damn it!</i>

488
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,250
S-Stop...

489
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,169
I'll win no matter what!

490
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,212
Don't flatter yourself!

491
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,297
Stop it!

492
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:19,196
Stop it!

493
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,439
<i>Damn.</i>

494
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,524
<i>I can't stop completely.</i>

495
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:45,522
What are you guys doing
on top of the hospital?

496
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:50,033
You went a bit too far
for just a fight, you two.

497
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,825
Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?

498
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,622
A Chidori of that size wasn't to be aimed

499
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:23,774
at a comrade from your own village.

500
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,004
Why are you acting like such a child...?

501
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,800
<i>Sure enough, his reunion with Itachi...</i>

502
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,787
<i>Damn it!</i>

503
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,670
<i>Naruto, how far will you go?</i>

504
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,675
Was it you who taught him
that technique?

505
00:43:15,707 --> 00:43:18,585
Even if it were a means
to resist the Akatsuki,

506
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:21,699
to think that you would
teach Naruto the Rasengan.

507
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:24,171
If he slipped up,
he would have killed Sasuke.

508
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,312
Right back at you...

509
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,023
That Chidori was also
considerably risky.

510
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:32,334
But I didn't think
Naruto was the kind of kid

511
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,655
who would use that jutsu on a comrade.

512
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:41,952
To Naruto, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time.

513
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:46,061
Well, someone he considers an equal.

514
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:51,211
He probably fell for
Sasuke's cheap provocations.

515
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,466
He's been chasing him
since the Academy days.

516
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,803
For him, it's neither
you nor me now.

517
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:03,769
More than anyone,
he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.

518
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,393
On the other side of the coin,

519
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,087
Sasuke feels the speed of
Naruto's growth at close range

520
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,648
and feels inferior.

521
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:13,776
Naruto has gotten strong.

522
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:17,555
So strong that he feels like
he isn't growing at all.

523
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,823
Revenge, huh?

524
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,911
I wonder if Itachi is
the one frustrating him.

525
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:27,114
That's why Sasuke doesn't
want to acknowledge Naruto.

526
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,190
If he acknowledges him,

527
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:31,634
he might end up denying
his own path up to this point...

528
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,382
Rivalry is a difficult thing.

529
00:44:37,027 --> 00:44:39,488
This isn't a very good development...

530
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:42,606
Maybe I’ll give him a little lecture.

531
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,307
Then I’ll leave Naruto to you.

532
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,518
I’ve got a mission coming up...
and there’s also the matter of the Chidori.

533
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:53,857
Sakura.

534
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,071
It's okay. Things can go back to
how they used to be.

535
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,115
Cheer up.

536
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,659
See ya.

537
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:13,836
Naruto...

538
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,338
Sakura.

539
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,510
Don't interfere with us!

540
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,041
<i>You are weak.</i>

541
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,461
<i>Why are you weak?</i>

542
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,714
<i>It's because you don't have enough...</i>

543
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,132
<i>... hate.</i>

544
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:11,525
Now that's a good look in his eyes.

545
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,475
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:39,648
If I don't do this,
you'll run away, right?

547
00:46:39,936 --> 00:46:43,106
You're not the type
to listen quietly to lectures.

548
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,053
Sasuke... Forget about revenge.

549
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:51,323
What?

550
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:55,403
Well, in this line of work,
I've seen plenty of guys like you.

551
00:46:55,484 --> 00:46:58,987
Those who live for revenge
always meet...

552
00:47:00,707 --> 00:47:01,958
a tragic end.

553
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:07,142
You'll only hurt yourself and
agonize more than now.

554
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:12,219
Even if you succeed in revenge,
all that will remain is emptiness.

555
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:13,261
Shut up!

556
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:14,928
What do you know?

557
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:18,419
Don't talk to me as if you know!

558
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,822
Well, calm down...

559
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:22,854
What if...

560
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:26,330
I were to kill the one you love most...

561
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,569
would that make you understand
how wrong you really are—

562
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:30,987
about everything you just said?

563
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:34,449
Well, I wouldn't mind if you'd do that.

564
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,492
Unfortunately, I don't even have
one person like that.

565
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,748
Everyone's already been killed.

566
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:46,670
I've lived longer than you have...

567
00:47:47,506 --> 00:47:48,673
It hasn't all been good things for me either.

568
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:53,841
I know all too well
the agony of losing those I care about.

569
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:00,684
Well, both you and I
aren't the lucky ones...

570
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,737
That's for sure.

571
00:48:04,104 --> 00:48:06,439
But we're not the worst off, either.

572
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:09,442
You and I,

573
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:12,583
we've both found precious comrades,
haven't we?

574
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,493
It's because I've lost people too
that I understand.

575
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,745
The Chidori is a power...

576
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:24,166
I gave to you because you now
have someone important to protect.

577
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,572
You should know that
it's not a power

578
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:30,183
to be used on your comrades
or for revenge.

579
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:34,225
I'm sure you know
what it should be used for.

580
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:39,806
Think carefully about whether
what I'm saying is wrong.

581
00:48:46,188 --> 00:48:49,024
As I recall,
that's Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

582
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:51,109
So let's wait a bit.

583
00:48:51,651 --> 00:48:56,489
Maybe you scum couldn't do it,
but I can.

584
00:48:56,656 --> 00:49:01,453
I wonder. Two should be ample
to rip him apart.

585
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:05,123
Stay out of it, you moron.

586
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:09,294
Tayuya, women shouldn't
use words like that...

587
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:10,586
Shut up, you fatso.

588
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:43,513
- <i>More, please!</i>
- <i>More, please!</i>

589
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:53,773
<i>Wanna head back?</i>

590
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,191
<i>Sure!</i>

591
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:59,830
<i>We both made it
to the top of the tree.</i>

592
00:51:17,964 --> 00:51:18,840
Sakura.

593
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:21,801
I have something to talk
to you about.

594
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,846
I'll go out on a date with you,
so come along.

595
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:46,451
Damn it...

596
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:50,997
<i>Damn it...</i>

597
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:53,029
<i>Damn it!</i>

598
00:51:57,027 --> 00:51:58,946
We are the Sound Four.

599
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:01,380
We're here on orders
from Lord Orochimaru.

600
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:03,943
I'm in a bad mood right now.

601
00:52:04,994 --> 00:52:07,240
If you want to fight, just know
that I won't go easy on you.

602
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:14,396
Stop your babbling, weakling.

603
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:16,898
<i>He called me... weak?</i>

604
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:19,252
Hey, come over here.

605
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:22,779
I'm going to play do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
on your ribs until they crack.

606
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,622
Are you saying that Orochimaru
left a Curse Mark on Sasuke's body?

607
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:30,842
Yes.

608
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:36,042
He said, "Sasuke will come to me
without fail, in search of power."

609
00:52:36,526 --> 00:52:39,465
I see. I didn't know such
a thing happened.

610
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:45,844
Orochimaru... I ran into him again
a little while back.

611
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:47,387
What?!

612
00:52:47,595 --> 00:52:49,431
He was one of the Sannin

613
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:52,350
and he's ridiculously strong
and dangerous.

614
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:56,479
But, everything will be okay!

615
00:52:57,647 --> 00:53:00,692
Sasuke wouldn't be tempted
by a guy like that!

616
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:02,724
He's already super strong,

617
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:05,085
so he doesn't need to do
that kind of thing!

618
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,704
Come with us.

619
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:16,040
If you do,
Lord Orochimaru will give you power.

620
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:19,135
What is your goal?

621
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:22,897
Are you and your comrades
just going to comfort each other

622
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:27,135
in a peaceful village like this,
trying to forget all about Itachi Uchiha?

623
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:30,311
Don't forget your goal.

624
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:33,841
A village like this does nothing
more than shackle you!

625
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:38,272
Just cut your worthless bonds
with this place.

626
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:43,529
If you do that, you'll be able
to obtain amazing power.

627
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:48,505
Don't forget your goal.

628
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,093
Why are you hanging around in a place
like this in the middle of the night?

629
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,434
You have to take this road
to leave the village...

630
00:55:00,979 --> 00:55:02,017
Go home and sleep.

631
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:17,817
Why...

632
00:55:19,372 --> 00:55:21,374
Why won't you tell me anything?

633
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:24,477
Why are you always silent like that?

634
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:27,188
You won't tell me one single thing.

635
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:29,340
Why should I have to tell you anything?!

636
00:55:32,444 --> 00:55:34,404
I'm telling you to keep your nose
out of my business.

637
00:55:35,384 --> 00:55:37,135
Stop bothering me
over everything I do.

638
00:55:40,935 --> 00:55:45,273
I... I'm always just causing trouble,
aren't I?

639
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:49,360
Do you remember?

640
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:54,782
We just became Genin and
the three-man squads were assigned...

641
00:55:56,826 --> 00:56:00,496
Yeah, I guess...
that was long ago, after all...

642
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,916
But it all began that day.

643
00:56:04,473 --> 00:56:06,044
Sasuke and me...

644
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:10,371
And also Naruto and Kakashi-sensei...

645
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:34,864
The four of us went
on various missions, didn't we?

646
00:56:36,908 --> 00:56:40,578
Those were tough and
difficult times, but...

647
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:51,172
But...

648
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:55,051
more than anything...

649
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:05,353
It was so much fun!

650
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:15,238
I know about your family, Sasuke...

651
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:18,157
But revenge...

652
00:57:20,257 --> 00:57:22,218
that won't bring anyone happiness.

653
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:24,831
No one...

654
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:27,750
Neither you...

655
00:57:30,294 --> 00:57:31,379
nor I.

656
00:57:34,173 --> 00:57:35,341
As I expected...

657
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,471
I'm different from you guys...

658
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:44,013
I'm walking my own path.

659
00:57:45,285 --> 00:57:46,661
The four of us worked together...

660
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:51,149
and it's true that there was a time
when I thought that was my road.

661
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,210
The four of us have worked together,

662
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,654
but in the end,
I decided on revenge.

663
00:57:59,115 --> 00:58:01,075
That's been my reason for living.

664
00:58:05,062 --> 00:58:07,314
I can't become like
you and Naruto.

665
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,502
Are you going to isolate
yourself again...?!

666
00:58:11,002 --> 00:58:14,338
Sasuke, you're the one who taught me
how painful it is to be alone!

667
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,592
Now I know exactly how that feels.

668
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:21,371
I have both family and friends...

669
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:24,998
But if you were no longer here, Sasuke...

670
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:26,934
for me...

671
00:58:28,226 --> 00:58:31,979
for me, it would be the same as being all alone.

672
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:39,709
From here on...

673
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:43,951
we're going to start walking
our new paths individually.

674
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,911
I...!

675
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,732
I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!

676
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,264
If you would only be with me, Sasuke,

677
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,406
I won't let you regret it,
no matter what!

678
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:58,561
I'll make it fun every day and
you will definitely find happiness!

679
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,573
I'll do anything for you, Sasuke!

680
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:06,677
So... I'm begging you,
please stay here!

681
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,646
I'll even help you with your revenge!

682
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:12,788
I'll make it happen somehow,
I promise you...!

683
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,995
So stay here... with me...!

684
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:21,280
If that doesn't work for you...

685
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,952
Then take me with you...

686
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:36,864
You really are... annoying.

687
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:41,878
Don't go!

688
00:59:43,307 --> 00:59:45,553
If you go, I'll scream and...

689
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:52,952
Sakura...

690
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:56,190
Thank you...

691
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,577
<i>Sasuke...</i>

692
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,817
We were waiting for you, Lord Sasuke.

693
01:00:24,262 --> 01:00:26,223
What's this all about?

694
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,907
It was already decided that
you would be our leader

695
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:33,259
the moment you left the village.

696
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,936
Please forgive our rudeness
up to now.

697
01:00:42,031 --> 01:00:43,699
I don't care about any of that.

698
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:51,078
Let's go.

699
01:00:58,294 --> 01:00:59,337
This is the beginning!

700
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:08,393
It's already four o'clock
in the morning...

701
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:11,182
The Fifth Hokage is such a slave driver.

702
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:14,251
She ought to retrieve
the documents she forgot herself...

703
01:01:18,147 --> 01:01:20,255
Huh... What's the matter?

704
01:01:24,616 --> 01:01:25,784
Hey! Wake up!

705
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:28,208
You'll catch cold if you sleep
in a place like this.

706
01:01:32,518 --> 01:01:33,185
Huh!

707
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:34,680
Sasuke!

708
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:40,687
What did you just say?!

709
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:41,778
Is that true?!

710
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:42,982
Yes...

711
01:01:43,506 --> 01:01:47,385
According to Sakura Haruno,
it appears that there's no mistake...

712
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:53,891
<i>So what that freak wants...</i>

713
01:01:55,685 --> 01:01:57,561
<i>is the Uchiha's power, huh...</i>

714
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:01,518
Izumo! Kotetsu!

715
01:02:02,233 --> 01:02:04,110
There's somebody
I want you to bring here!

716
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:11,664
Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!
Your Dad's mission starts today, too!

717
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:14,194
There's not that much time
for morning training!

718
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,080
Okay, Okay.

719
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:17,860
One "Okay" is enough!

720
01:02:19,188 --> 01:02:21,899
<i>Nag, nag, nag from early
in the morning...</i>

721
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:26,391
I wonder who it could be
so early in the morning?

722
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,747
Hey... Dad...

723
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:31,969
What is it?

724
01:02:32,356 --> 01:02:35,192
Why did you marry
a tough woman like Mom?

725
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:38,678
Let's see now...

726
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:42,523
Even though Mom's like that,
she smiles gently sometimes...

727
01:02:42,996 --> 01:02:44,248
Maybe that's why...

728
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,361
Is that the only reason?

729
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:53,173
Shikamaru!

730
01:02:54,744 --> 01:02:57,038
A messenger from the Fifth Hokage
is here.

731
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:05,546
Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out
of the village late last night.

732
01:03:07,173 --> 01:03:08,411
And... it's almost certain

733
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:11,064
that he is headed for
the Hidden Sound Village.

734
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:13,637
Slipped out?! Why...

735
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:17,767
Because he was enticed by
that Orochimaru!

736
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:22,126
W-W-Wait a minute!

737
01:03:22,855 --> 01:03:26,776
Why would Sasuke get tempted
by a creep like that?!

738
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:31,572
The reason doesn't matter.
In any case, there's no time.

739
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:36,160
You will perform your first mission
as a Chunin...

740
01:03:37,453 --> 01:03:39,830
So all I have to do
is bring Sasuke back?

741
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,196
<i>As long as there aren't
any enemies around,</i>

742
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:44,306
<i>that shouldn't be too much of a drag...</i>

743
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:50,356
Yes... However, not only is time
of the essence on this mission,

744
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:53,043
but it may turn into something
quite difficult.

745
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:53,846
Huh?!

746
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,973
There is a strong possibility that

747
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:59,751
those under the control of Orochimaru
are guiding Sasuke.

748
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:03,646
<i>This is turning into a real drag.</i>

749
01:04:04,157 --> 01:04:11,623
<i>That guy... I actually respected him
in a lot of ways...</i>

750
01:04:13,277 --> 01:04:17,114
In that case, please give me
a four-man team

751
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:19,662
composed only of Jonin and Chunin.

752
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:22,832
I'm afraid I can't do that...

753
01:04:23,207 --> 01:04:24,542
Huh! Why?!

754
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,764
You already know
the answer to that...

755
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:33,300
Right now, only the barest minimum
number of Jonin have been left behind

756
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:36,085
and the others have all
left the village on missions.

757
01:04:39,178 --> 01:04:40,971
Within the next 30 minutes,

758
01:04:40,996 --> 01:04:45,333
Gather the best available Genin
and leave the village!

759
01:04:50,998 --> 01:04:54,960
There's one guy I want to recommend.

760
01:04:55,966 --> 01:04:58,099
What! You've gotta be kidding!

761
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:03,164
You're so damn loud this early
in the morning...

762
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:06,346
<i>But why this guy?</i>

763
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,755
<i>That jerk!</i>

764
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:14,717
Hey, just wait here!

765
01:05:14,774 --> 01:05:16,150
I'll change my clothes immediately!

766
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:22,265
So, do you have your eye...

767
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,793
on any other awesome guys besides me?

768
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,355
Yeah...

769
01:05:28,105 --> 01:05:29,648
Wake up! Hey!

770
01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:32,026
You said excellent guys, right...

771
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:34,487
Can't be helped...

772
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:40,034
Potato chips?

773
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:44,330
They're barbecue flavor...
you want to help out too, right?

774
01:05:44,496 --> 01:05:45,039
Huh?!

775
01:05:52,926 --> 01:05:53,627
Here he comes!

776
01:05:58,052 --> 01:05:59,261
Even if it is just potato chips,

777
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:02,206
I won't give the last chip to anyone,
I don't care who it is!

778
01:06:04,183 --> 01:06:07,770
Choji and I have worked as
a team for many years,

779
01:06:07,895 --> 01:06:10,439
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

780
01:06:12,274 --> 01:06:13,943
I understand that,

781
01:06:14,068 --> 01:06:17,529
but in this kind of situation,
you'd normally ask Shino first!

782
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:19,865
Oh, shut up.

783
01:06:27,164 --> 01:06:29,083
Fat chance!

784
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:42,525
Shino is on a special mission
with his father.

785
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:45,597
Hey... don't tell me...

786
01:06:45,622 --> 01:06:46,998
Right. He's in.

787
01:06:47,023 --> 01:06:48,232
No way!

788
01:06:51,105 --> 01:06:54,024
I see... Sounds interesting...

789
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:57,903
It looks like it was worth getting up early
and going for a walk, doesn't it?

790
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:00,201
Shikamaru, is there anyone else?

791
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:03,942
I'd like to take my time to look for more,
but we're pressed for time.

792
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:08,327
If we don't find anybody else
by the time we leave the village,

793
01:07:08,352 --> 01:07:09,562
it will be just us!

794
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:12,876
I see...

795
01:07:13,294 --> 01:07:17,381
It's a drag,
but the more people we have, the better...

796
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,595
<i>Damn... At a time like this, I...</i>

797
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:30,311
Lee! Do what you need to do.

798
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,008
All right!

799
01:07:35,327 --> 01:07:38,544
Everybody, follow me!

800
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:39,987
Hey...

801
01:07:40,509 --> 01:07:41,885
Hey, Naruto...

802
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:46,558
I'm supposed to be the squad leader.
Though it sure is a drag...

803
01:07:47,686 --> 01:07:50,856
You really think everything will be okay
if things are left in your hands?

804
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:53,031
You don't seem very reliable...

805
01:07:54,072 --> 01:07:57,409
What's up with you acting
like the boss, Naruto?

806
01:07:57,796 --> 01:08:01,383
Although being ordered about by
some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru

807
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:03,576
doesn't sit right with me either...

808
01:08:04,823 --> 01:08:07,659
But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!

809
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:10,415
We have to follow his orders.

810
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:14,038
It means the village elders recognized him

811
01:08:14,063 --> 01:08:15,647
as capable of being a leader.

812
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:21,487
Since that's the case,
come up with some strategy and plan.

813
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,630
From what I heard,
there are enemies

814
01:08:23,655 --> 01:08:25,824
and there's a strong possibility
that they'll ambush us.

815
01:08:27,034 --> 01:08:29,578
For a start,
as this is a rescue operation,

816
01:08:29,603 --> 01:08:31,188
we will be in the position
of pursuit.

817
01:08:31,722 --> 01:08:35,393
In other words,
the enemy can easily gain the initiative.

818
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:39,938
Therefore, I will decide
on a deployment formation

819
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,382
that will respond quickly
to any assault by the enemy.

820
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,192
If you ignore my orders and
act on your own,

821
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:47,552
we will all die.

822
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:53,310
We will go in a single file formation.

823
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:57,293
First,
the all-important spearhead will be...

824
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:00,526
Kiba, that's you!

825
01:09:02,277 --> 01:09:04,446
You and Akamaru go on
walks year-round

826
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:07,502
and are therefore well versed in the
terrain and geography of the Land of Fire.

827
01:09:07,658 --> 01:09:09,201
And since your nose is
very sensitive,

828
01:09:09,284 --> 01:09:11,370
you can track Sasuke
with your sense of smell and,

829
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:13,981
you can distinguish booby traps
that carry the enemy's scent

830
01:09:14,006 --> 01:09:15,406
which makes them
easy to find...

831
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:20,020
And moreover, you and Akamaru as
a pair will be extremely efficient

832
01:09:20,045 --> 01:09:24,383
in compensating for the single file
formation's vulnerability to assault.

833
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:28,929
And... second in line will be me,
the squad leader.

834
01:09:29,555 --> 01:09:32,349
I can give orders
as required in any situation

835
01:09:32,374 --> 01:09:34,535
from my position
directly behind Kiba

836
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,355
and can give orders to those behind me
using only hand signals.

837
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:42,518
And in the middle...
in the number three position is Naruto.

838
01:09:43,902 --> 01:09:45,946
The middle position is
the best for you,

839
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,132
since you're capable
of executing quick moves

840
01:09:48,157 --> 01:09:51,243
and are able to respond immediately
to anything in front or behind.

841
01:09:51,715 --> 01:09:55,469
You're our key player...
And you have your Shadow Clones.

842
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,518
And fourth in line is Choji.

843
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:02,921
You. You don't have speed,

844
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:05,732
but your ability to strike is the best
among the squad members.

845
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:09,153
Kiba, our point man, along with me and Naruto
can launch a surprise attack,

846
01:10:09,178 --> 01:10:10,929
and I'm saving you for the final strike.

847
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,921
In other words, your role is
to attack the routed enemy.

848
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:16,101
And last, bringing up the rear,
is you, Neji...

849
01:10:16,637 --> 01:10:20,724
You are assigned to
the most difficult position: rear lookout.

850
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:23,417
You'll use your Byakugan
to constantly check

851
01:10:23,735 --> 01:10:25,236
that there are no blind spots
in our formation.

852
01:10:25,777 --> 01:10:27,905
Got it? Take a careful look at this.

853
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:37,778
Use this diagram to verify
the radius of your assigned watch.

854
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:40,501
Kiba watches the front,

855
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:43,014
I'm responsible for
a wide forward view,

856
01:10:43,795 --> 01:10:48,342
Naruto watches left, Choji right,
and Neji...

857
01:10:48,842 --> 01:10:52,137
Using your Byakugan,
you'll cover our entire rear flank.

858
01:10:53,347 --> 01:10:57,017
I want to get a handle on our current
combat capabilities.

859
01:10:57,728 --> 01:11:01,398
Let me check all the ninja equipment
each of you currently has...

860
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,482
I will commit that
to memory straight away.

861
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:05,526
Any questions?

862
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:10,828
<i>Even though he just assembled
this team a short while ago,</i>

863
01:11:11,114 --> 01:11:13,742
<i>he's already created
the best possible formation...</i>

864
01:11:14,981 --> 01:11:18,943
If not, I want to tell you
the most important thing last.

865
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:23,850
Sasuke isn't a close friend,

866
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,209
and I don't even particularly like him.

867
01:11:31,301 --> 01:11:35,290
However, he is also a shinobi belonging
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

868
01:11:35,315 --> 01:11:36,524
He is a comrade!

869
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,892
Therefore, I will put my life
on the line to help him!

870
01:11:39,705 --> 01:11:41,248
That's the way
of the Leaf Village.

871
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:46,567
In this case, even I can't just sit back
and slack off.

872
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:50,984
Because I am responsible
for your lives.

873
01:11:55,242 --> 01:12:00,455
Wow... You're actually acting like a Chunin!

874
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:05,377
Okay then, as soon as he has checked
our ninja tools, we'll depart.

875
01:12:06,003 --> 01:12:07,629
Everybody, take out your ninja tools.

876
01:12:16,638 --> 01:12:19,891
<i>Sasuke wouldn't be tempted
by a guy like that...</i>

877
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:22,077
<i>He's already super strong,</i>

878
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:26,273
<i>so he wouldn't need to do
that kind of thing! I guarantee it!</i>

879
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,488
<i>Damn... Why, Sasuke...?!</i>

880
01:12:34,406 --> 01:12:36,283
All right! Let's go!

881
01:12:36,308 --> 01:12:36,975
Wait!

882
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:43,897
Sakura!

883
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,073
I heard the whole story
from Lady Hokage.

884
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:50,475
I'm sorry, but I can't take you along
on this mission.

885
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:55,785
Even you weren't able
to convince Sasuke, right?

886
01:12:57,638 --> 01:13:01,683
All that can be done now is for us
to use force to convince him...

887
01:13:02,392 --> 01:13:05,687
Sakura, your role in this has ended.

888
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:15,146
Naruto... This is a...
once-in-a-lifetime request...

889
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:20,794
Please... bring Sasuke back.

890
01:13:22,579 --> 01:13:28,752
I couldn't do it!
I wasn't able to stop Sasuke!

891
01:13:30,145 --> 01:13:34,399
At this point, the only person
who would be able to stop Sasuke...

892
01:13:34,657 --> 01:13:36,539
who would be able to save him...

893
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:40,574
is you... Naruto...

894
01:13:51,316 --> 01:13:54,945
You like Sasuke so much,
don't you, Sakura?

895
01:13:56,488 --> 01:14:00,283
I really understand

896
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:03,203
how painful it must be
for you right now, Sakura.

897
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:10,752
<i>Sakura, there's one thing
I want to ask you.</i>

898
01:14:10,836 --> 01:14:11,753
<i>Huh?</i>

899
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:15,006
<i>How do you feel about... Naruto?</i>

900
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:20,429
<i>Getting in the way of romance
just seems to be his thing.</i>

901
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,557
<i>He actually seems to be enjoying
my suffering.</i>

902
01:14:24,057 --> 01:14:27,269
<i>Naruto doesn't understand
a single thing about me.</i>

903
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:28,981
<i>He's just annoying.</i>

904
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,151
Naruto... thank you...

905
01:14:46,674 --> 01:14:52,096
I'll bring Sasuke back without fail!
That's a promise of a lifetime!

906
01:14:55,297 --> 01:14:58,300
<i>You always understood me...</i>

907
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:02,220
<i>You always helped me...</i>

908
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:07,889
<i>Naruto...</i>

909
01:15:13,482 --> 01:15:15,250
Hey, hey, Naruto!

910
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:18,653
Are you sure it's okay to make
a promise like that?!

911
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:21,639
Sure! I never go back on my word.

912
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:23,909
That's my Ninja Way!

913
01:15:24,326 --> 01:15:27,412
All right! Let's hurry up and go!

914
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:31,650
We've lost a little time...
Let's hurry!

915
01:15:32,334 --> 01:15:32,876
Okay!
