1
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:02,626
What did you say?!

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,131
You're telling me only rookies
went after Sasuke?!

3
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,326
It really couldn't be helped...

4
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,440
Given the village's situation...

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,678
Hey, hey!

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,607
Your mission has already
been assigned!

7
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:24,070
Well, I'm just running an errand.
I'll be right back.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,564
Don't worry.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,112
Honestly...

10
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

11
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,915
First, fan out in every direction...

12
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:50,978
and track Naruto and Sasuke's scent.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,054
Did you say Naruto and Sasuke?

14
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,806
Did something happen
to the two of them?

15
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,894
I'll explain later...
We're short on time.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,771
Okay.

17
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,482
As soon as you confirm that
you've detected the scent,

18
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,509
signal me, and I'll come right away.

19
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,875
All right! Scatter!

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,748
<i>Well, she saw them fight
with her own eyes...</i>

21
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,417
<i>telling her not to worry is useless.</i>

22
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,051
<i>Please, let me make it in time!</i>

23
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,105
Sasuke!

24
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,465
Are you going to
run away from me?!

25
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,589
Yo... loser.

26
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,279
It's you this time, huh?

27
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:09,232
<i>I couldn't do it.
I couldn't stop Sasuke...</i>

28
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:14,259
<i>I think...
the one who can stop Sasuke...</i>

29
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:16,760
<i>the one who can save Sasuke is...</i>

30
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,959
<i>Naruto... you are the only one.</i>

31
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:27,558
<i>Naruto... This is a...
once-in-a-lifetime request...</i>

32
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:33,048
<i>Please... bring Sasuke back.</i>

33
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,903
What's with that face?

34
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:54,127
<i>So, you asked Sakura for a hint
the other day, what did she tell you?</i>

35
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,169
<i>Shall we go?</i>

36
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:00,788
<i>Yup.</i>

37
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,014
<i>Why...?</i>

38
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>Who knows?
My body moved on its own.</i>

39
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,572
<i>You rescue Sakura, no matter what!</i>

40
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,872
<i>Sasuke... You...</i>

41
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>I could still distract him
for a little while.</i>

42
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,126
<i>I lost everything once.</i>

43
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:43,393
<i>I refuse to watch my precious comrades
die in front of me again.</i>

44
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,680
Why...?

45
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,184
Why, Sasuke?

46
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,981
Why did you become like this?!

47
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,315
You!

48
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,657
What does it matter to you
what happens to me?

49
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,464
I have my own way.

50
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,997
No matter who it is,

51
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,037
nobody has the right
to tell me what to do.

52
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,461
Let me be clear.

53
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:22,926
I'm done playing ninja with you guys
from the Leaf.

54
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,301
Go home.

55
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,810
Everyone...

56
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:41,317
Everyone risked their lives
to come after you!

57
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,279
So what?

58
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>Lastly, I will tell you
the most important thing.</i>

59
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:09,433
<i>Sasuke isn't a close friend,
and I don't even particularly like him.</i>

60
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:14,062
<i>But Sasuke is a shinobi of
the Hidden Leaf Village...</i>

61
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,751
<i>A comrade.</i>

62
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,059
<i>That's why we will rescue him
by risking our lives.</i>

63
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,481
<i>That's the way of the Leaf.</i>

64
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,788
What do our comrades from the Leaf
mean to you?!

65
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,966
Snap out of it!

66
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,569
Did I get any stronger by staying
with all of you?

67
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,980
I'm going to Orochimaru.

68
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:16,682
Orochimaru is the person who killed
the Third Hokage

69
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,301
and tried to crush the Leaf Village!

70
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,252
Do you think he'll give you
that power for free?

71
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,048
He just wants your body
as a vessel!

72
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,381
You might not be able to come back.
You might get killed.

73
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:35,586
You think I'd just let you
go to a place like that?!

74
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,623
That doesn't matter to me...

75
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,732
If my goal is accomplished,
then that's all that matters.

76
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,631
If you intend to get in my way...

77
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,464
Then it can't be helped...

78
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,705
I won't let you go! I'll drag you back,
even if I have to break every bone in your body!

79
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,462
Why are you laughing?!

80
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,091
You were laughing at that time too.

81
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,969
That time...?

82
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:17,359
You wanted to fight me then, right?

83
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,310
That was...

84
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:27,550
That was not the kind of fight I wanted.

85
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,989
Even now... this is not...

86
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,076
I don't care about your circumstances.

87
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,866
<i>What... is this power?</i>

88
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:39,472
<i>If it's like this now...
If I release this curse mark...</i>

89
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,561
<i>I wonder how much power...</i>

90
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,205
I awakened long ago...

91
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:09,460
From the fool I was,
dreaming of a peaceful future...

92
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,558
Wasting time with my comrades.

93
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,228
That's why I left the village.

94
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,939
That's why I sought power!

95
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,359
My dream is not in the future.

96
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,238
My dream is in the past...

97
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,707
That's the only place it exists.

98
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,390
Wow, Big Brother!

99
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:22,573
You hit the target right in the middle,
even the one behind the rock!

100
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,609
All right, me too!

101
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,327
Sasuke, let's go home.

102
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:34,474
Come on... You promised
you'd teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

103
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:39,476
I have an important mission tomorrow
and I need to prepare.

104
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,679
Liar...

105
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,442
Forgive me, Sasuke...
Maybe next time.

106
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,988
Big Brother, watch me!

107
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,868
Hey! If you push yourself...

108
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:17,291
Why is the one who twisted
his ankle laughing?

109
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,300
Were you being careless?

110
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,968
That's not it...

111
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,638
Because....

112
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:28,015
I'm finally starting
at the Academy tomorrow!

113
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,127
Oh...

114
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,524
What's up?

115
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:40,075
This is the place...
where Father works, right?

116
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,406
Yeah... The headquarters
of the Leaf Police Force.

117
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:47,066
I was curious about it before,

118
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:51,965
but why is the Uchiha Clan crest
the mark of the Police Force?

119
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,602
Oh... so you noticed, huh?

120
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,750
Of course...

121
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,923
Yeah... Let me see...
To put it simply...

122
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:04,610
It seems the previous generations
of the Uchiha Clan

123
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,555
set up and established the Police Force.

124
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,185
So they used their clan crest as
the organization's symbol.

125
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,329
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has always been

126
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,215
in charge of protecting
the public and the peace of this village.

127
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,321
The Uchiha crest is the symbol
of our proud clan.

128
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,701
The Uchiha Clan has grown smaller now.

129
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,372
But even now, nearly all members
belong to the Police Force here.

130
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,916
And contribute to maintaining
peace in the village.

131
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,090
Only exceptional shinobi
can handle crimes

132
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:42,913
committed by shinobi, so...

133
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,303
Father is so awesome!

134
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,207
Are you going to enter
the Police Force, too?

135
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,698
Well... I'm not sure...

136
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,837
Why not?!

137
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,940
When I grow up, I'm also going
to enter the Police Force!

138
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,902
Father's also coming to
tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

139
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,070
It's the first step to my dream.

140
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,173
That's right.

141
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,704
You're late... What were you doing?

142
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,283
Father...

143
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,584
I have something to talk to you about.
Come quickly.

144
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
About tomorrow's special mission...

145
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,718
I've decided to go with you, too.

146
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

147
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,766
If you complete this mission, Itachi...

148
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,353
your place in the ANBU Black Ops
will be guaranteed!

149
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,649
You understand, right?

150
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,739
You don't have to be so worried.
More importantly...

151
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,035
Umm... Father...

152
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,564
Tomorrow's my...

153
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,916
Tomorrow's mission will be
a very important mission not just for you,

154
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,785
but for the Uchiha Clan!

155
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,219
I'm withdrawing from tomorrow's mission.

156
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,263
What are you talking about?!

157
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,689
You should know how important
a day tomorrow is!

158
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,772
I'm going to Sasuke's Academy
entrance ceremony tomorrow...

159
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,070
Relatives are supposed to attend
the Academy entrance ceremony.

160
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:31,484
There was a notice,
wasn't there... Father?

161
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:36,923
I get it already.

162
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,916
I'll go to the Academy...

163
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,378
Your left leg...

164
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,218
Be sure to ice it.

165
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,757
Right...

166
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,781
Everyone! Congratulations
on your entrance!

167
00:16:55,906 --> 00:17:00,244
From this day forward, I expect you to
work hard on the path of the shinobi.

168
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,315
I'd like you to bring further prosperity
to the Hidden Leaf Village.

169
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,657
Oh! I remember
the time when Itachi entered.

170
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,868
As expected of his brother.

171
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:20,342
Thank you for your help with both boys.

172
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:22,339
Oh, it's nothing like that.

173
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,893
A prodigy, the likes of which
the Academy has never seen...

174
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,173
There were no students
as exceptional as that boy.

175
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,822
That's a bit too much praise.

176
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,084
Not at all...

177
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm hopeful for you, too.

178
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,193
Become a fine shinobi
just like your brother.

179
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,353
Yes.

180
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,859
Hey... That's Uchiha, right?

181
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,360
Yeah.

182
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,738
I wonder... if he's awesome, too.

183
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,365
Hmm... Must be.

184
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:02,831
Recess at last! What a drag.
I'm still not used to this place...

185
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,511
You want some too, Shikamaru?

186
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,921
I mean, you spend
every recess eating.

187
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,395
That's my boy...

188
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm confident you'll do great
in the ANBU.

189
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,033
This won't do!

190
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,660
Won't do!

191
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:44,312
Really...

192
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,252
You should rest your body
on your days off at least.

193
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,296
You don't have to push it.

194
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,593
I heard... that big brother graduated
from the Academy in just one year.

195
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,763
Times were different back then.

196
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,560
Besides, he's a bit special...

197
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,315
Now, I'm going to hand out
the report cards for the first half.

198
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,790
Do as well as your brother did.

199
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:43,807
<i>Father... I wanted you to say,
"That's my boy," to me, too...</i>

200
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
What did you say?

201
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,839
What do you mean you can't attend
the clan meeting tomorrow?!

202
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,319
You don't understand your own position!

203
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,782
I'm setting out on a mission tomorrow.

204
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,745
<i>What are they doing this late
at night with the lights off?</i>

205
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,538
What mission?!

206
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,159
I can't say...
It's a top secret mission.

207
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,051
Itachi... You are the link that
connects our clan

208
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:20,870
with the village higher-ups.

209
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,884
You know that, don't you?

210
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,528
Yeah...

211
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:31,355
Keep that well in mind!
And come to tomorrow's assembly!

212
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:34,311
Sasuke...

213
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,986
Get to bed after
you've gone to the bathroom.

214
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,239
Right...

215
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,408
What are you doing hanging around
this late at night?

216
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,910
Get to bed!

217
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,328
Okay.

218
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,421
Father only ever thinks about you,
Big Brother.

219
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,425
Do you hate me?

220
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,680
It's okay.

221
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,685
It's natural for a shinobi to be hated.

222
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,687
That's not how I feel...

223
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:19,903
<i>Brother's right.
I really do... think ill of him...</i>

224
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,783
Excellence is not easy at all.

225
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:29,035
Power isolates you, and it makes
you arrogant.

226
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,041
Even if you're coveted
and sought after at first.

227
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,045
But, we're the only brothers
we have.

228
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:42,718
I will always be the wall
you must overcome.

229
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,807
Even if it means you end up hating me...
That's what big brothers are for.

230
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,892
Is Itachi home?!

231
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,894
I need to talk. Come out!

232
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,235
Why's everyone gathered here?

233
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,822
Two people were absent
from yesterday's assembly.

234
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,274
Why didn't you come?!

235
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:12,599
<i>He didn't go to the assembly father
was talking about last night, after all.</i>

236
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:14,946
I understand that when you enter ANBU,

237
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,183
you get caught up in all sorts
of trouble.

238
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,424
Your father said something
like that in your defense.

239
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:26,987
But as far as we're concerned,
you get no special treatment.

240
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,432
Understood. I shall be careful next time.

241
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,019
Now I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

242
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:40,144
Right... But before that,
there's a little more I want to ask you...

243
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:47,732
It's about Shisui Uchiha, who committed suicide
by throwing himself into the Nakano River...

244
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,618
<i>Suicide?!</i>

245
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,580
The other person who didn't come
to the assembly was Shisui.

246
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,960
As I recall, you adored him
like a real older brother.

247
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:05,286
I see... I hadn't seen him at all recently.

248
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,636
That's too bad.

249
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:14,059
And we, the Police Force, have decided
to launch an all-out investigation.

250
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,562
Investigation?!

251
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,773
This is the will Shisui wrote.

252
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:22,445
The analysis of the handwriting
has been completed.

253
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,903
No mistake, he did indeed write it.

254
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,740
If there's no sign of murder,
what is there to investigate?

255
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:34,054
It would be easy for a Sharingan user
to forge the handwriting.

256
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,751
The most adept Uchiha.

257
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,600
The man feared as
Shisui of the Body Flicker.

258
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,174
He was a man who would take
the lead, no matter the mission,

259
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,742
if it was for the sake of the clan.

260
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:49,406
It's tough to think that

261
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:52,816
such a man would leave something
like this and kill himself.

262
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:57,644
You shouldn't judge people based on
appearances and assumptions alone.

263
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,356
For the time being,
I leave the will with you.

264
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:06,695
Take this and request cooperation
from ANBU Black Ops in the investigation.

265
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,488
Understood...

266
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,451
I hope we get a lead.

267
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:16,569
Also, we have our own connection
to ANBU Black Ops.

268
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,226
We'll know right away if you try
to bury the investigation request.

269
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,840
Why don't you just come right out
and say it?

270
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,137
You suspect me, don't you?

271
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,265
That's right, you brat...

272
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,850
Listen up, Itachi.

273
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,924
Just try to do something
like betraying the clan and...

274
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,934
it'll cost you!

275
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:52,307
I told you before.

276
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,995
You shouldn't judge people
only on looks and speculation.

277
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:02,000
You judged me as patient
and took me lightly.

278
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,503
Clan... Clan...

279
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,965
You foolishly overestimate
your own abilities...

280
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,837
and you underestimate my own.
That's why you are cowering before me.

281
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,098
<i>I've never seen him like this...</i>

282
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:20,120
Half a year after entering ANBU...

283
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,272
the strangeness of your behavior
couldn't be overlooked.

284
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,776
What the hell are you thinking?

285
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,836
Fixated on the organization,

286
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,948
fixated on the clan,
fixated on the name.

287
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:38,231
This obsession is what constrains
you and limits your own potential.

288
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,905
And it's a foolish thing...

289
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:44,735
to fear and hate
what one has never seen or known...

290
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
Stop, Itachi!

291
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,256
What the hell's the matter
with you?!

292
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:52,666
Itachi...
You've been a little strange lately.

293
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:09,401
My potential is being stifled
by this foolish clan!

294
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:14,751
Because you're fixated
on insignificant things like clans...

295
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,567
you lose sight of what's truly important.

296
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,663
True change cannot be made if stuck
within the restrictions of regulations,

297
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,083
and constrained predictions
and imagination...

298
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:26,405
Such arrogance!

299
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,923
Enough! Any more of this foolishness,
and you'll be imprisoned.

300
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,718
Why... Big Brother?

301
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,345
What was that?!

302
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:42,142
I've had enough! Captain, 
order his imprisonment!

303
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,936
Big Brother! Stop it already!

304
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,877
I'm not the one who killed Shisui.

305
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,823
But I apologize for
my numerous slips of the tongue.

306
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,908
I'm very sorry...

307
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,042
Recently, it seems he's been up
to his ears in ANBU Black Ops missions

308
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:08,821
and is a little tired...

309
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,086
Captain!

310
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,465
The ANBU Black Ops is under
the direct control of Lord Hokage...

311
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:18,303
Even the Police Force can't arrest him
without a warrant.

312
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,681
I will take the responsibility
and monitor him.

313
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:23,892
Please...

314
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,504
Understood...

315
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:53,102
<i>What was that...
in my brother's eyes?</i>

316
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,259
<i>That wasn't...
just an ordinary Sharingan.</i>

317
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,141
<i>And... quite a bit of time's
passed since then...</i>

318
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:08,824
<i>but things are still awkward
between him and Father.</i>

319
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,054
Good morning, father...

320
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,640
Yeah, good morning.

321
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,870
How have things been
going at the Academy lately?

322
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,399
My classes at the Academy are boring.

323
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,735
I'm always at the top of the class, so...

324
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,983
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

325
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,122
<i>W-Wow...</i>

326
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,084
This is the fundamental
jutsu of the Uchiha.

327
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,795
The sign is as I taught you earlier.

328
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:17,859
You build up chakra,

329
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,341
and pool it in your chest,

330
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,594
and spew it out at once after that.

331
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,512
Try it.

332
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,472
Okay!

333
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:31,805
<i>Father... is teaching me jutsu himself.</i>

334
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,316
<i>Finally... father has also recognized me!</i>

335
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,193
<i>I must live up to his expectations!</i>

336
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,281
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

337
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,400
I suppose it's not like with Itachi.

338
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,528
It might've still been
too soon for you.

339
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:02,192
<i>A member of the Uchiha Clan
is not recognized as full-fledged</i>

340
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,302
<i>until they've mastered
this Fire Style.</i>

341
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,257
<i>The Uchiha crest...</i>

342
00:30:11,804 --> 00:30:14,307
<i>symbolizes the Uchiha
who controls fire.</i>

343
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,860
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

344
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

345
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,089
<i>Today for sure!</i>

346
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,051
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

347
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:51,312
Sasuke...!

348
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:53,549
Wait a minute.

349
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:55,270
What is it?

350
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,359
What...?

351
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,945
Oh... Don't move.

352
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:07,949
Okay, finished!

353
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,287
Mother...

354
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:13,043
Hmm?

355
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,500
No... It's nothing.

356
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,585
Okay...

357
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,011
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

358
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:44,175
<i>I'm just... getting started.
Damn it! One more time!</i>

359
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,331
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

360
00:31:59,125 --> 00:31:59,792
Father!

361
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,502
Hmm?

362
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,547
One more time...

363
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,427
One more time...
Please watch me.

364
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:11,997
It's still too soon for you.

365
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,266
Even if I were to teach you
for another week...

366
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,810
It's not that...

367
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,356
I've gotten... the hang of the jutsu.

368
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,608
So I want you to see it.

369
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,875
<i>Failure is not an option!</i>

370
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,804
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

371
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,582
That's my boy.

372
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:21,892
You've done well.

373
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:25,353
From now on, train hard
and aim even higher,

374
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:28,105
and don't bring shame to the crest
on your back.

375
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,886
Right!

376
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:36,684
And... let me say one thing.

377
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,102
Don't follow in your
big brother's footsteps.

378
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,162
Mother...?

379
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:55,759
Hmm?

380
00:33:56,192 --> 00:34:01,573
What does Father really think
about me and Big Brother?

381
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,869
What is it all of a sudden?

382
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,154
the other day, Father said to me,
"That's my boy."

383
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,721
He'd always said that only
to Big Brother.

384
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,811
So I was really happy.

385
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:22,445
I see... Good for you.

386
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:27,973
But lately, Father and Big Brother
haven't been getting along, so...

387
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,112
I was thinking...

388
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,499
that maybe I'm just a substitute
for Big Brother.

389
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,580
Your older brother's your older brother.
And you are you.

390
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,170
Your father cares deeply
about you both.

391
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,422
Then why does he only think
about Big Brother?!

392
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,992
That's not it...

393
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:53,958
Your father has to protect
the Uchiha Clan

394
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:56,299
as a representative of the clan.

395
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,138
What about it?!

396
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:02,596
Itachi is just bigger than you
and is your elder.

397
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:04,810
He'll naturally be entrusted

398
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,923
with that much more work
for the clan, right?

399
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,691
Your father is the supervisor
of the work, so...

400
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,823
it's natural that his attention
is on your older brother.

401
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,899
But, this is just between us.

402
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,666
When he's with me,

403
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,395
your father does nothing
but talk about you.

404
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:37,992
He's just always sullen
and awkward, so...

405
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,398
Big Brother!

406
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,957
Today...

407
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,841
after school, can you help me
with my shuriken training?

408
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:54,068
I'm busy... Have father teach you.

409
00:35:55,377 --> 00:35:59,548
But you're better at shuriken jutsu,
Big Brother...

410
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,701
Even I can see that.

411
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,506
Why do you always treat me
like such a nuisance?

412
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,724
Forgive me Sasuke...
Maybe next time, okay?

413
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,048
I don't have time to
pay attention to you today.

414
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:49,430
You always poke my forehead
and say, "Forgive me, Sasuke."

415
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:53,096
You always say, "Maybe next time,"
but "next time" never comes.

416
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:05,323
Father.

417
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,015
Huh?

418
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,689
Why doesn't Big Brother
pay any attention to me?

419
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,916
That guy's a little strange...

420
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,234
He's the type who doesn't like
to get close to people.

421
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:22,865
Why?

422
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,993
I don't know.

423
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:32,250
Even as his father,
I still can't read that boy...

424
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,377
Here!

425
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,003
Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!

426
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,980
If you're worried about doing
shuriken jutsu practice,

427
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,341
I will watch you when you get home.

428
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,720
It's not practice,
it's training.

429
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,932
See you later!

430
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,523
Sasuke, are you on
your way to school?

431
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,442
Yes.

432
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,849
I saw Itachi earlier on.
He's really become a man.

433
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,155
He's already a top-notch shinobi.

434
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:06,717
He graduated at the head of his class
at the Academy at the age of seven,

435
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,078
and became a Chunin at the age of ten,
right?

436
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,249
He became adept at using
Sharingan at the age of eight.

437
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,336
Yes, I remember.

438
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,632
That boy is truly
the pride of the Uchiha clan.

439
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,219
By the way,
how old are you now, Sasuke?

440
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:31,861
<i>I'm the same age as
when Big Brother graduated,</i>

441
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,935
<i>but I can't...</i>

442
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,162
What's the matter?

443
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:35,980
Hey!

444
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,941
Stop talking nonsense!

445
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,443
Oh my, dear.

446
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,197
Sasuke, both you and Itachi
come from the Uchiha clan,

447
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:47,375
the most elite clan in
the Hidden Leaf Village.

448
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,262
Have confidence!

449
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:53,519
You'll be an amazing
shinobi just like Itachi one day.

450
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,458
Yeah!

451
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,335
See you later!

452
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,295
Do your best!

453
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,464
Study hard!

454
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,142
<i>I won't lose to Big Brother!</i>

455
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,902
<i>I'm pretty late...</i>

456
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,417
<i>What was that?</i>

457
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,544
<i>I had the feeling
there was someone there...</i>

458
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,311
Wh-What's this?!

459
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,153
<i>What in the world is this?!</i>

460
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,376
<i>Uncle... Auntie...</i>

461
00:40:22,229 --> 00:40:24,132
Father... Mother...

462
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,934
<i>There's somebody here!</i>

463
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,902
<i>Move!</i>

464
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>Move!</i>

465
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,449
<i>Move!</i>

466
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,472
Father! Mother!

467
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:34,314
Big brother!

468
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:37,012
Big brother!
Father and Mother are...!

469
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,346
Why? For what reason?!

470
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:42,253
Who in the world would do
something like this...?

471
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,398
What are you doing, Big Brother?!

472
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,995
My foolish little brother...

473
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,110
<i>Mangekyo Sharingan!</i>

474
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,169
<i>My legs...!</i>

475
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,532
<i>Stop!</i>

476
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,227
<i>Big Brother!</i>

477
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:46,006
<i>Don't make me see this!</i>

478
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,091
<i>Why...?</i>

479
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,652
<i>Why did you, Big Brother...?!</i>

480
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,571
<i>No!</i>

481
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,864
<i>No...</i>

482
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,501
<i>Auntie! Uncle!</i>

483
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,713
<i>Father! Mother!</i>

484
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,923
<i>Stop it! Big Brother!</i>

485
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,051
<i>Don't kill Father and Mother!</i>

486
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,508
Why...

487
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,472
Big brother... Why did you?

488
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,270
To test the limits of my own ability.

489
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,149
To measure your vessel?

490
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,085
Is that all?

491
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,369
Only for that reason...
you killed everyone...?

492
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,668
You gotta be kidding!

493
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:54,005
<i>I'm scared...</i>

494
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,984
<i>I'm scared!</i>

495
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,112
Don't kill me...!

496
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,065
I don't believe it!

497
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:38,421
This is too unlike you, big brother.
I mean...

498
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,905
The reason I acted as the big brother
you desired was...

499
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,617
because I wanted to test
your own potential.

500
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:51,832
You have the potential
to become my opponent

501
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:54,812
in order to assess
my vessel.

502
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,399
You hated me...

503
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:04,128
and you continued to have
the desire to surpass me.

504
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,514
That is why I'm letting you live...

505
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:09,845
for my own benefit.

506
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:15,674
You are someone who could be able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.

507
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,236
However, on one condition...

508
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:30,954
You must kill
your closest friend...

509
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,000
Y-You've gotta be kidding...

510
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,754
Just like I did...

511
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,884
Big brother... you killed Shisui?!

512
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,597
That's right... and because of
that I obtained these eyes.

513
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:53,410
The main hall of Nakano Shrine...

514
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,039
Underneath the seventh tatami mat
on the far right

515
00:46:57,364 --> 00:46:59,825
is the secret gathering place
of the Clan.

516
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,905
There you will find the
recorded secret of...

517
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:11,549
the very purpose of the
Uchiha Clan's visual jutsu.

518
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:15,264
<i>The real purpose of the Uchiha Clan's visual jutsu...?</i>

519
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:19,353
If you attain these eyes,

520
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:22,411
you will become the third person
including myself

521
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:25,647
to use
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

522
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,928
If that happens...

523
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:32,035
then there will have been meaning
in my allowing you to live.

524
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,228
However... at present...

525
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:39,255
You are not worth killing.

526
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:42,378
My foolish little brother...

527
00:47:42,677 --> 00:47:45,258
If you want to kill me,
then begrudge me!

528
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:46,607
Hate me!

529
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,534
And live on in shame.

530
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,122
Run... run...
and cling to your pathetic life.

531
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,626
And one day, when you have
the same eyes as I do...

532
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:02,197
you will come before me.

533
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:22,927
Wait!

534
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,653
<i>A dream...?</i>

535
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,417
Yes... that's right.

536
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,529
The only one who survived...
is that boy.

537
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:24,007
Didn't he have an older brother?

538
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,883
Yes, but he's gone missing...

539
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:35,790
It can't be true...
That elite Uchiha Clan...

540
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:01,554
Oh, Sasuke! What are you buying today?

541
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:20,446
<i>The main hall of Nakano Shrine...</i>

542
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,815
<i>Under the seventh tatami mat
from the right...</i>

543
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:28,541
<i>is our clan's secret gathering place...</i>

544
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:38,876
I see... So that's what it is...

545
00:50:45,098 --> 00:50:47,019
Hey, Shikamaru...

546
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,088
Wanna go to the candy shop
after school?

547
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,531
Huh... No way.

548
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:54,176
You can get away with that
'cause your mom's nice,

549
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:57,780
but if my mother found out that I bought
myself a snack before going home,

550
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,880
I'd be in big trouble.

551
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,241
Did you hear the news...

552
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:05,353
that entire Uchiha Clan
was apparently murdered?

553
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,399
Yeah, my dad told me.

554
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,986
Apparently he's the only one
who survived...

555
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,379
<i>That's my boy.</i>

556
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,092
<i>When we're alone, all
your father talks about is you...</i>

557
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:47,104
I wonder... what kind of things
father was saying to mother...

558
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,451
<i>If you want to kill me...</i>

559
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:02,784
<i>Begrudge me! Hate me!</i>

560
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,171
<i>If it's for the purpose of killing you,</i>

561
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:16,050
<i>I will plunge into any darkness
that lies ahead!</i>

562
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,304
<i>I will obtain that power no matter what!</i>

563
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,933
<i>From now on, I am an avenger!</i>

564
00:52:27,113 --> 00:52:30,354
<i>Sasuke is now in depths of darkness...</i>

565
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,317
<i>If you stop in a place like this...</i>

566
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,820
<i>you won't be able to catch up
with Sasuke.</i>

567
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,385
<i>Neji, it's just like you said.</i>

568
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,513
<i>Sasuke's in the depths
of darkness right now...</i>

569
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:08,084
<i>He really hit me with
his full strength! Damn it!</i>

570
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:19,071
Don't you consider me...
your comrade any longer?!

571
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:25,703
Don't all the things we did together
on Team 7 mean anything to you?!

572
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:29,515
It wasn't meaningless...

573
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:36,318
To me, you became my... closest friend.

574
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,259
We've become... friends?

575
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,720
Then... why?!

576
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:44,570
All the more reason why...

577
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,683
All the more reason why...

578
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:50,778
I have to defeat you.

579
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,944
I don't fully understand but...

580
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:03,365
I get that you want to fight me for real!

581
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,166
Sasuke...!

582
00:54:15,392 --> 00:54:16,977
Like I said...

583
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,259
In truth, you were waiting
for this too, weren't you?

584
00:54:23,808 --> 00:54:25,976
Kakashi and Sakura aren't here.

585
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,684
So there's nobody here
to stop us like before.

586
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,561
You...!

587
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,734
<i>Chidori!</i>

588
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,909
<i>You idiot...</i>

589
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,456
I'll do the same!
I'm gonna knock you out...

590
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:54,998
and drag you back to the village
if I have to!

591
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,645
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

592
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,475
<i>Rasengan!</i>

593
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,980
<i>Damn...</i>

594
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,733
<i>He was able to counter</i>

595
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:02,616
<i>my full-power Chidori to that extent...</i>

596
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,781
<i>Naruto...!</i>

597
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:21,211
<i>Well, your limit is two blows...
that's about it.</i>

598
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,467
<i>And if I try to use more than that...</i>

599
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,177
<i>what will happen?</i>

600
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:32,279
<i>The third blow won't initiate.</i>

601
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,224
<i>Remember that well.</i>

602
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,145
<i>If you try to initiate
the jutsu forcibly...</i>

603
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,648
<i>not only will it not
initiate properly,</i>

604
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,691
<i>but your chakra will become zero...</i>

605
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:45,190
<i>Worst-case scenario,
it'll cost you your life!</i>

606
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:50,282
<i>Damn... I can't waste a blow...</i>

607
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,744
<i>It wouldn't serve any purpose
if we cancel each other like earlier.</i>

608
00:56:56,205 --> 00:57:00,417
<i>There's... no longer
any mistake about this.</i>

609
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,107
<i>You... really intended...</i>

610
00:57:20,697 --> 00:57:22,393
<i>You really intended to...</i>

611
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:28,320
<i>I will use high-speed techniques
and jutsu to create an opening.</i>

612
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:33,392
<i>And then... I'll land a Chidori.</i>

613
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,706
<i>Sasuke...</i>

614
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,256
Did you know, Naruto...

615
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:53,095
Top-class ninja should be
able to read each other's hearts

616
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,706
simply by an exchange of fists.

617
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,392
How about it?

618
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,661
Were you really able
to read inside...

619
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,033
my own heart?

620
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,613
<i>Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!</i>

621
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:28,714
<i>Sasuke... I knew that you were always alone.</i>

622
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,819
<i>At first, I was relieved when I found out</i>

623
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,347
<i>that there was someone else just like me.</i>

624
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:44,652
<i>And it also made me happy...</i>

625
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:48,086
<i>Truth is, I wanted to talk to you right away.</i>

626
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:56,575
<i>But... I couldn't do it.</i>

627
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,621
- <i>Awesome...</i>
- <i>You're incredible...</i>

628
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,831
<i>You were always able
to do everything.</i>

629
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,560
<i>And moreover, you were always
being praised by everyone.</i>

630
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:18,099
<i>Because you and I
were so different...</i>

631
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,987
<i>Because I was jealous,
I decided you were my rival.</i>

632
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:28,651
<i>I didn't want to lose to you...</i>

633
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:31,502
<i>and I felt that even more strongly...</i>

634
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,873
<i>because I was called a loser.</i>

635
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,660
<i>Even when we were on Team 7,</i>

636
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:41,637
<i>I continued to feel
the same way the whole time.</i>

637
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,586
<i>I'm stubborn...</i>

638
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:47,710
<i>And wasn't able to express
what I really felt...</i>

639
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:54,132
<i>What I really wanted was
to become like you.</i>

640
00:59:55,246 --> 01:00:01,562
<i>You were my goal...</i>

641
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:05,827
<i>You are one of the ones
I want to fight.</i>

642
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:11,058
<i>I was really happy when
you said that!</i>

643
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:17,306
<i>Those were your first words...
acknowledging me...</i>

644
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:21,161
<i>You and I both knew,</i>

645
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,902
<i>without us even having to
have an exchange of fists!</i>

646
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,665
<i>From that time on...</i>

647
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:29,511
<i>Even without saying anything...</i>

648
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,257
<i>To me, you're...</i>

649
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,975
<i>my closest friend.</i>

650
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:45,893
<i>However... you're trying to
take me down for real.</i>

651
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,103
<i>Right now, I don't really know</i>

652
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:52,856
<i>whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not.</i>

653
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,823
<i>Thinking that we were friends...</i>

654
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,788
<i>That might have been...</i>

655
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,871
<i>That might have been just me...</i>

656
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,292
It's too late now!

657
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:11,783
Naruto!

658
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,639
<i>If that's the case... I'm...</i>

659
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,563
<i>I'm so pathetic, aren't I...</i>

660
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,099
<i>I don't know why but...</i>

661
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:43,751
<i>I don't know why...</i>

662
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:45,505
<i>But I...</i>

663
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,148
<i>I...</i>

664
01:01:56,976 --> 01:01:58,097
<i>don't want you...</i>

665
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,306
<i>to be taken away
by someone like Orochimaru!</i>

666
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:17,776
You managed to divert it
with your left hand,

667
01:02:18,255 --> 01:02:20,298
but it's meaningless.

668
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,438
You can't make hand signs...

669
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:28,395
or use that jutsu of yours anymore.

670
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,075
<i>This is the end!</i>

671
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,125
<i>That's Naruto?</i>

672
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,961
<i>What is this intimidating power?</i>

673
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:04,138
<i>And what was that
red chakra earlier on?</i>

674
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,843
<i>Is this guy a monster?</i>

675
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,432
What the heck are you?!

676
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,143
Your friend!

677
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:18,355
That's why I'm telling you

678
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,982
I'm not gonna let someone like
Orochimaru get their hands on you!

679
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,111
I'm telling you, I'll stop you...

680
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:27,135
even if I have to break every bone in your body!

681
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:16,139
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

682
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,001
Come on! Snap out of it!

683
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:09,024
If you don't come to your senses,
I'll have to break your bones

684
01:06:09,128 --> 01:06:12,285
so that you can't move
and I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!

685
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,307
Shut up...

686
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,395
What the heck do you,

687
01:06:22,864 --> 01:06:25,148
who has neither parents nor brothers,
think you understand?

688
01:06:26,698 --> 01:06:29,377
What makes you think that you,
who's been all alone from the start,

689
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,914
could possibly understand
how I feel?!

690
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,869
It's because I had those bonds
that I suffer like this!

691
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,014
How could you possibly understand...

692
01:06:41,612 --> 01:06:43,695
what it feels like to lose all that!

693
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:14,030
It's true that I can't understand...

694
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:16,446
how it feels to really
have parents or brothers...

695
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:18,868
However...

696
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,788
<i>It's my treat today...
Eat your fill!</i>

697
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,723
<i>Yippee!</i>

698
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:28,687
When I'm with Iruka-sensei,
I imagine...

699
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,422
- <i>Dig in!</i>
- <i>Dig in!</i>

700
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,426
<i>Ninja, first, need to
warm their inner man.</i>

701
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,015
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't get too carried away
and overeat!</i>

702
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,854
Maybe this is...
what it feels like to have a dad.

703
01:07:48,784 --> 01:07:50,123
When I'm with you...

704
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,194
<i>Idiot, idiot, idiot...</i>

705
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:55,300
<i>What was that, you loser?!</i>

706
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,576
<i>I'm not gonna lose to you,
no matter what!</i>

707
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,244
<i>Go ahead and say
whatever you want.</i>

708
01:08:02,805 --> 01:08:04,014
<i>How about this?</i>

709
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,999
<i>Better not start feeling
too comfortable.</i>

710
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:11,701
Maybe...
this is what it's like to have a brother.

711
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:15,612
Why is it, Naruto...?

712
01:08:16,919 --> 01:08:19,546
Why do you go so far for me?

713
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:23,303
Because for me, this is the first
real bond I've ever had!

714
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:47,756
That's why I'm gonna stop you.

715
01:08:56,157 --> 01:09:02,079
It's too late, Naruto...
It's already too late.

716
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,684
I can't go back anymore.

717
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:21,379
Come, Naruto!

718
01:09:22,728 --> 01:09:25,906
Then, I will sever that bond.

719
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,082
Sever that bond...?

720
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,505
Then why are you wearing that headband?

721
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:40,252
I'll acknowledge you... You're strong.

722
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:42,487
And the reason for that is

723
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,348
you know the same pain
of loneliness that I do.

724
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,853
And that pain makes people stronger.

725
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:53,581
That's why, by severing that bond,

726
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:56,293
I will be able to obtain
even greater strength.

727
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,489
I will fight you now on equal terms.
However...

728
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:06,829
You won't even be able to put
a scratch on my forehead.

729
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,956
That's something that
won't change in the least.

730
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:13,960
It seems that whatever I say
won't have any effect anymore, huh?

731
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,963
Sasuke!

732
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,382
I'm done with talking...

733
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,760
From here on, it's only fighting.

734
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,319
Come!

735
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,232
<i>I'm able to see...</i>

736
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:53,500
<i>I'm now able to see
this guy's movements...</i>

737
01:10:53,525 --> 01:10:55,610
<i>which I wasn't able to see before.</i>

738
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,506
<i>I'm able to see them!</i>

739
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,226
Damn it!

740
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,188
<i>When he moves...</i>

741
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,191
<i>from the subtle shifts in
how he exerts his strength...</i>

742
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,362
<i>I can vividly see
an image of his next move.</i>

743
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,288
<i>With my level of eyes,</i>

744
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,250
<i>I don't need to use unnecessary chakra
and can instead preserve it.</i>

745
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,504
<i>The Curse Mark takes
too much chakra.</i>

746
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,924
<i>If I can see this much...</i>

747
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:49,414
<i>I can time my attacks to the images of
Naruto's movements as I foresee them.</i>

748
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,151
<i>This is no good...</i>

749
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,405
<i>He's totally reading my movements.</i>

750
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,784
<i>Damn it!</i>

751
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,295
Sasuke!

752
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,390
<i>Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!</i>

753
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:56,552
Sa-su-ke...

754
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,437
It's too late, Naruto.

755
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,776
It's too late now! Naruto!

756
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,042
You're weak, aren't you, boy?

757
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:16,679
You better be grateful to me...

758
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:19,897
and to the Fourth Hokage

759
01:15:19,922 --> 01:15:24,510
who sealed me inside
a brat like you!

760
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,630
What's going on?

761
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,499
<i>What was that just now?</i>

762
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,210
<i>Even if I'm able to read
Naruto's movements completely...</i>

763
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,921
<i>his chakra makes
a separate move of its own.</i>

764
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:19,093
<i>It's as if the chakra itself
has a will of its own...</i>

765
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,264
<i>Even with my eyes
I'm unable to read it completely.</i>

766
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,977
<i>That red chakra...
that's not an ordinary chakra!</i>

767
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,316
<i>Your target is Naruto, after all.</i>

768
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,944
<i>Capturing Naruto is the primary mission</i>

769
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:41,355
<i>assigned to us by the Akatsuki.</i>

770
01:17:41,834 --> 01:17:42,877
<i>I see...</i>

771
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:46,746
<i>It appears that you have
some kind of special power.</i>

772
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,749
Now I understand!

773
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,724
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

774
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,283
<i>That chakra is protecting him?!</i>

775
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:29,372
<i>Calm down.</i>

776
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:33,175
<i>I won't get caught as long as
I fight from a distance.</i>

777
01:19:30,034 --> 01:19:33,186
<i>Damn it... This is incredible!</i>

778
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,772
<i>All I can do is dodge...</i>

779
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,429
Damn it, gimme a break...

780
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:12,933
If I get tainted by this power...

781
01:20:13,243 --> 01:20:17,747
I don't even know what
will happen to me in the end...

782
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:22,651
But, I have no other choice,
do I, Naruto?

783
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:38,751
It is certainly true
that you're special...

784
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:42,171
However...

785
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,988
I'm more special than you are.

786
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:55,434
<i>Sasuke!</i>

787
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,491
By special...

788
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:15,591
By special, you meant that?!

789
01:21:20,985 --> 01:21:22,987
I don't feel like I can lose.

790
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:37,027
Sasuke... you...

791
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:46,837
<i>This body...</i>

792
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:50,758
<i>It looks like there's no time to waste.</i>

793
01:22:59,897 --> 01:23:03,025
<i>I don't have any feeling
in my left arm...</i>

794
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,357
That power you have...

795
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,804
seems to involve
some risks too, huh?

796
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:17,660
Did you know?

797
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,125
That this place...

798
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,420
is called the Final Valley.

799
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:37,012
This is a fitting stage,
don't you think, Naruto?

800
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,440
Oh yeah...

801
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:52,378
I said there'd be
no more talking, didn't I?

802
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:56,949
Well, in that case,
how about we bring it to a close...?

803
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:59,265
This battle...

804
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,204
All our battles up to now!

805
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,520
- <i>Rasengan!</i>
- <i>Chidori!</i>

806
01:29:09,112 --> 01:29:11,864
It's started to rain!
Will it erase the scent?

807
01:29:13,055 --> 01:29:14,182
No problem.

808
01:29:14,832 --> 01:29:16,410
We're already close.
This way.

809
01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:26,047
<i>Am I too late...?</i>

810
01:29:26,623 --> 01:29:27,683
Naruto!

811
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,870
Why did things come to this?!

812
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,231
This is Sasuke's...

813
01:30:01,306 --> 01:30:05,664
<i>I didn't make it in time...
please forgive me.</i>

814
01:30:19,919 --> 01:30:21,045
Naruto...

815
01:30:22,724 --> 01:30:24,392
I know the kind of person you are...

816
01:30:25,477 --> 01:30:26,907
You must have fought desperately.

817
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,013
<i>Sasuke...</i>

818
01:30:56,169 --> 01:30:57,629
The Final Valley...

819
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:01,522
To think that Sasuke and Naruto
would battle it out here...

820
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:07,387
How ironic...

821
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:11,007
Yeah...

822
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,929
When I look at
the flow of this water,

823
01:31:16,936 --> 01:31:23,443
it's as if I'm being confronted
by an eternal battle...

824
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,735
Just like the fate of the two people
depicted in these statues here

825
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,846
who founded the Hidden Leaf Village...

826
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:44,206
As long as Naruto and Sasuke both live...

827
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,605
<i>You have to kill...</i>

828
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:10,169
<i>your closest friend!</i>

829
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:26,249
<i>I'm not gonna...</i>

830
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:30,112
<i>do everything you say!</i>

831
01:32:37,992 --> 01:32:41,537
<i>I will obtain power my own way!</i>

832
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:46,645
<i>I will surpass you
doing it my own way!</i>

833
01:32:47,878 --> 01:32:49,338
<i>Without fail!</i>

834
01:33:03,376 --> 01:33:06,225
The rain's... let up, hasn't it?

835
01:33:07,742 --> 01:33:08,531
Yeah.

836
01:33:24,918 --> 01:33:26,241
With that much rain,

837
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,500
I won't be able to pursue
the scent anymore.

838
01:33:30,073 --> 01:33:33,159
Naruto is more important now
than pursuing Sasuke.

839
01:33:35,061 --> 01:33:35,836
Yeah.

840
01:33:42,669 --> 01:33:44,003
Kakashi-sensei...

841
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:47,664
Where's Sasuke?

842
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,993
Kakashi!

843
01:33:57,403 --> 01:33:58,845
What's Naruto Uzumaki's condition?

844
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:00,191
He's okay.

845
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,723
What about Sasuke?
Where's Sasuke Uchiha?!

846
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,190
How are the other Genin?

847
01:34:14,706 --> 01:34:17,125
Yes! By the Hokage's order,

848
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:18,953
the first and second medical corps
have been dispatched...

849
01:34:19,557 --> 01:34:21,593
The wounded from all areas have
already been gathered.

850
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:25,660
They were transported after
receiving emergency treatment.

851
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,304
How are their conditions?

852
01:34:27,462 --> 01:34:29,950
Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries...

853
01:34:30,473 --> 01:34:34,784
Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,
but it's not life-threatening.

854
01:34:35,531 --> 01:34:39,410
Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi
are in critical condition.

855
01:34:40,209 --> 01:34:42,294
At this point,
there's no telling what will happen.

856
01:34:55,065 --> 01:34:56,232
<i>Everyone...</i>

857
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:11,065
<i>The ingredients and
effects of the medicine</i>

858
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:13,792
<i>have been thoroughly researched.</i>

859
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,754
<i>Excellent...</i>

860
01:35:16,469 --> 01:35:18,012
Now bring the deer antler!

861
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:19,005
Yes, ma'am!

862
01:35:24,549 --> 01:35:26,306
How is he, Sis?

863
01:35:33,705 --> 01:35:35,631
No walks for him for quite a while...

864
01:35:36,061 --> 01:35:38,021
The muscles of his limbs
have been severely damaged.

865
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:40,777
You're a vet, right, Sis?
Can you do something...?

866
01:35:41,006 --> 01:35:42,067
It'll be okay.

867
01:35:42,598 --> 01:35:46,492
It'll take time. But there's no threat
to his life, so rest easy.

868
01:35:50,033 --> 01:35:52,619
Walks for you are out of the question
for quite a while, too!

869
01:35:54,397 --> 01:35:56,316
Yeah, I know...

870
01:36:10,715 --> 01:36:13,926
It's almost been three hours...
Please take over.

871
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,145
All right!

872
01:36:15,513 --> 01:36:18,599
We are using our chakra as a medium
to regenerate the cells,

873
01:36:18,819 --> 01:36:21,876
so don't miscalculate the
regeneration rate for the damaged areas!

874
01:36:22,147 --> 01:36:22,958
Right!

875
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:26,364
As for the chakra control, handle it
as if we're threading a needle!

876
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:27,657
Understood!

877
01:36:48,888 --> 01:36:51,432
There's no point in
you getting frustrated, right?

878
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,976
Missions come with sacrifice...

879
01:36:55,397 --> 01:36:57,399
You took the mental training, right?

880
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:04,189
Training and a real battle
are two different things.

881
01:37:05,038 --> 01:37:07,296
I know what missions are about...

882
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:11,743
And I thought I knew what
the shinobi world is like.

883
01:37:13,817 --> 01:37:18,458
I became a squad leader
for the first time on this mission.

884
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,502
With that, I understood...

885
01:37:21,724 --> 01:37:23,713
I'm not cut out to be a shinobi.

886
01:37:24,437 --> 01:37:27,884
Surprisingly fragile... for a man.

887
01:37:29,641 --> 01:37:30,862
This time...

888
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:33,973
The only thing I was able to do
as squad leader...

889
01:37:34,602 --> 01:37:36,726
was to believe in everyone.

890
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:39,354
I was naïve...

891
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:41,731
I didn't have enough power...

892
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,983
It's all my fault!

893
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:47,237
Are you afraid of getting hurt?

894
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,876
Shikamaru...

895
01:38:03,766 --> 01:38:06,756
Are you going to let a girl
talk you down and just run away?

896
01:38:07,982 --> 01:38:09,348
I don't want to argue.

897
01:38:09,373 --> 01:38:13,169
It's a drag, and besides, I'm not a woman.

898
01:38:13,665 --> 01:38:16,933
Yeah... But you're not a man, either.

899
01:38:17,487 --> 01:38:19,769
You're just a coward!

900
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:23,148
Even if you quit being a shinobi,
the missions will still go on.

901
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:26,109
Someone has to do it.

902
01:38:26,918 --> 01:38:30,213
Your comrades will just
be dispatched again...

903
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:32,339
under a different squad leader.

904
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:35,722
And your comrades might die there.

905
01:38:36,298 --> 01:38:39,597
But if you were
the squad leader...

906
01:38:40,115 --> 01:38:42,941
your comrades might be saved
from that happening to them.

907
01:38:43,895 --> 01:38:47,438
If you reflect on this time,
make use of the experience and learn,

908
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:50,688
you might be able to carry out
missions more perfectly.

909
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:56,406
If you really think your comrades
are important to you,

910
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,827
before you think about running away...

911
01:38:59,388 --> 01:39:03,900
think about how to become
a leader they need!

912
01:39:04,446 --> 01:39:09,003
That's what real comrades are,
you coward!

913
01:39:28,592 --> 01:39:30,215
He's okay, now!

914
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:35,061
The antidote has stopped
the cellular necrosis

915
01:39:35,086 --> 01:39:38,547
caused by the side effects of the pills.

916
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,559
You were a huge help this time, Shikaku.

917
01:39:42,317 --> 01:39:45,897
The Nara Clan's secret medicinal
preparation manual was very useful.

918
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:50,610
It must've been tough to
make something like that...

919
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,376
It's the result of daily study.

920
01:39:54,108 --> 01:39:55,193
Thanks...

921
01:39:55,786 --> 01:39:56,764
Lady Tsunade!

922
01:40:01,846 --> 01:40:05,022
Neji Hyuga...
His life is no longer in danger.

923
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:10,588
And, there's some information...

924
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:15,426
Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki
have just now returned.

925
01:40:16,154 --> 01:40:20,158
Although seriously injured,
it seems it's not life-threatening.

926
01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:31,598
Two, huh?

927
01:40:32,515 --> 01:40:36,037
Shikamaru...
It seems the mission was a failure.

928
01:40:40,827 --> 01:40:45,164
But, everyone is alive!
That's the most important thing.

929
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,806
Next time for sure...

930
01:40:52,515 --> 01:40:54,296
I'll carry out the mission perfectly!

931
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:14,110
Sasuke... You're the chosen one.

932
01:41:14,772 --> 01:41:18,367
Whatever... Just give me power.

933
01:41:23,701 --> 01:41:28,247
Even though he looks different,
it's still Lord Orochimaru.

934
01:41:28,775 --> 01:41:31,832
If you don't want to die,
be more careful how you speak.

935
01:41:35,488 --> 01:41:37,865
<i>Wh-What? This chakra...</i>

936
01:41:38,216 --> 01:41:42,600
<i>Yes...
My future lies within this boy...</i>

937
01:41:53,971 --> 01:41:56,724
Oh... You were awake, huh?

938
01:41:57,988 --> 01:41:58,962
Shikamaru!

939
01:42:02,427 --> 01:42:05,685
I'm going on ahead to Choji!
What about you?

940
01:42:06,569 --> 01:42:09,939
I'm going to see... Naruto and Sasuke!

941
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:14,666
I see... So everyone's okay.
That's good.

942
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,489
Then, Sasuke...

943
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:26,524
Yeah... he's gone.

944
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:46,540
Then, I still can't see him...?

945
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,358
Yeah... But Lady Tsunade said that
he should regain consciousness soon.

946
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,860
Thank goodness...

947
01:42:56,646 --> 01:42:58,356
It's really a great help that

948
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,925
Lady Tsunade returned
to the Leaf Village.

949
01:43:02,151 --> 01:43:04,387
If she hadn't, right about now,
Choji would be...

950
01:43:06,768 --> 01:43:10,059
The Fifth Hokage...

951
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,350
You've come to visit?

952
01:43:22,851 --> 01:43:24,449
Information sure travels fast.

953
01:43:31,333 --> 01:43:32,372
<i>Sakura...</i>

954
01:43:33,904 --> 01:43:34,729
Naruto...

955
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:42,842
I heard you suffered
quite a serious injury...

956
01:43:43,561 --> 01:43:45,344
But you look well, considering...

957
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,602
I'm sorry... Sakura...

958
01:43:56,145 --> 01:43:58,127
Why do you apologize?

959
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:07,074
You went and got yourself hurt
again, didn't you?!

960
01:44:07,684 --> 01:44:10,119
Jeez, you look like a mummy...

961
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:13,873
I'm sorry... I...

962
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:19,507
Hey... The weather's nice today.
So open the curtains.

963
01:44:23,983 --> 01:44:25,985
Sakura! I...

964
01:44:26,316 --> 01:44:28,777
I'll keep my promise, no matter what!

965
01:44:29,137 --> 01:44:33,141
I promised on my life.
That's what I said, so I...!

966
01:44:35,366 --> 01:44:37,805
It's okay, Naruto...

967
01:44:39,498 --> 01:44:40,958
Sakura! He...

968
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,063
I've always...

969
01:44:43,426 --> 01:44:45,780
said that... I...

970
01:44:46,601 --> 01:44:49,450
I don't go back on my word!

971
01:44:50,051 --> 01:44:52,249
That's my Ninja Way!

972
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:12,515
Naruto...

973
01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:18,854
<i>Thanks, Naruto...</i>

974
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:28,322
<i>I'll get right to healing this injury
and then I'll bring Sasuke back!</i>

975
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:33,411
Wh-What was that?!

976
01:45:38,184 --> 01:45:40,167
P-Pervy Sage?!

977
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:42,545
Yo!

978
01:45:46,246 --> 01:45:49,385
I've come today to tell you
something important.

979
01:45:50,332 --> 01:45:53,222
From here on,
as my official disciple,

980
01:45:53,606 --> 01:45:56,472
I'll train you to become
a full-fledged shinobi in three years.

981
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,060
Three years...?

982
01:45:58,938 --> 01:46:03,094
I've received some credible
information concerning the Akatsuki.

983
01:46:03,595 --> 01:46:04,464
<i>Akatsuki...</i>

984
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:09,658
It seems that it will be
three or four years

985
01:46:10,104 --> 01:46:12,533
before they come after you next.

986
01:46:15,315 --> 01:46:16,829
I don't care about that!

987
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,858
Talking about stuff that's
so far down the road...

988
01:46:20,275 --> 01:46:23,091
I don't have time for slow-paced training!

989
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,338
What do you mean?

990
01:46:26,047 --> 01:46:28,466
If I don't go after Sasuke immediately,

991
01:46:28,684 --> 01:46:31,520
he might be killed by Orochimaru!

992
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:35,948
It seems you've learned
of the true purpose

993
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:38,142
for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke...

994
01:46:38,487 --> 01:46:41,126
Huh?! So you knew too, Pervy Sage?

995
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:46,567
I was looking into
Orochimaru's Immortality Jutsu.

996
01:46:47,169 --> 01:46:48,461
It seems with that jutsu,

997
01:46:48,669 --> 01:46:54,075
he can't transfer to a new vessel
for another three years.

998
01:46:54,617 --> 01:46:59,584
And, unable to wait for Sasuke,
he had to transfer to a new vessel recently.

999
01:47:00,371 --> 01:47:04,502
He'll be okay for another three years...
There is time.

1000
01:47:05,193 --> 01:47:07,529
That's not a lie, is it?!

1001
01:47:08,249 --> 01:47:09,596
Not a lie, is it?!

1002
01:47:11,916 --> 01:47:12,927
Nope.

1003
01:47:17,967 --> 01:47:19,552
However...

1004
01:47:21,644 --> 01:47:24,438
Forget about Sasuke...

1005
01:47:26,505 --> 01:47:30,801
Sasuke went to Orochimaru
on his own free will.

1006
01:47:31,161 --> 01:47:33,997
No matter what you do,
he won't change.

1007
01:47:36,942 --> 01:47:39,387
I've seen many shinobi, so I know...

1008
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:43,247
Sasuke is just like Orochimaru.

1009
01:47:45,385 --> 01:47:49,146
If you're thinking about bringing him back
just forget it.

1010
01:47:49,257 --> 01:47:52,469
Trying to do that is just
arrogant and foolish!

1011
01:47:52,811 --> 01:47:58,489
He may be nothing to you,
but he's my friend!

1012
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:01,033
Would a friend hurt his comrade?!

1013
01:48:01,465 --> 01:48:04,442
Take a look at your current condition!

1014
01:48:05,634 --> 01:48:06,718
This is...!

1015
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:15,287
<i>Why? Why would you...?</i>

1016
01:48:16,193 --> 01:48:18,339
<i>We were called Sannin together...</i>

1017
01:48:18,364 --> 01:48:21,409
<i>Weren't we comrades
since we were kids?!</i>

1018
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:26,475
<i>In every regard,
you're a foolish guy, Jiraiya...</i>

1019
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:29,814
<i>You're reckless and
never think things through.</i>

1020
01:48:30,472 --> 01:48:34,708
<i>That's why you didn't notice
what I was doing.</i>

1021
01:48:35,183 --> 01:48:39,271
<i>Won't you reconsider, Orochimaru?</i>

1022
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:40,931
<i>Absurd!</i>

1023
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,768
<i>How can you be so stupid?!</i>

1024
01:48:46,214 --> 01:48:48,094
<i>No matter how much I wanted it...</i>

1025
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:51,567
<i>in the end, there was no way
he would come back.</i>

1026
01:48:52,137 --> 01:48:56,674
<i>After the agony, all that was left was
my own powerlessness and regret.</i>

1027
01:48:57,607 --> 01:49:01,856
<i>I don't want you to go through
the same thing...</i>

1028
01:49:06,763 --> 01:49:09,724
If you're going to go after Sasuke,
then there'll be no training.

1029
01:49:10,414 --> 01:49:12,136
I'll get ANBU Black Ops to watch you

1030
01:49:12,245 --> 01:49:15,421
and depending on the case,
prohibit you from leaving the village.

1031
01:49:17,658 --> 01:49:19,785
You're not just an ordinary kid...

1032
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:22,807
You possess the Nine-Tailed Fox,
which the Akatsuki is after!

1033
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:25,659
This is serious.
I'll just have to do that...

1034
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:29,396
if you're going to act on your own
without listening to what I say.

1035
01:49:32,564 --> 01:49:34,794
Eventually, you're going to have to deal

1036
01:49:34,819 --> 01:49:37,863
with guys more troublesome
than Orochimaru.

1037
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:41,200
Give up on Sasuke.

1038
01:49:42,539 --> 01:49:44,546
Sooner or later this was
going to happen.

1039
01:49:45,617 --> 01:49:48,766
Stop suffering over him.
Just let him go.

1040
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,418
It's not just jutsu or power...

1041
01:49:51,704 --> 01:49:55,243
A shinobi needs the insight
to make the right call.

1042
01:49:56,048 --> 01:49:58,884
And if you're going to live
as a shinobi, become wise.

1043
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:01,362
If you remain a fool...

1044
01:50:01,387 --> 01:50:03,889
the reality is that it will be tough
living in this world.

1045
01:50:06,519 --> 01:50:07,476
Fine.

1046
01:50:09,946 --> 01:50:12,326
If that's what being wise is...

1047
01:50:12,984 --> 01:50:14,693
Then I'll gladly be a fool
for the rest of my life!

1048
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:17,945
Even if by myself,

1049
01:50:18,129 --> 01:50:22,091
I'll create an even more awesome jutsu
and bring Sasuke back, no matter what!

1050
01:50:22,242 --> 01:50:25,486
And I'll kick the Akatsuki's butt, too!

1051
01:50:41,173 --> 01:50:44,051
If someone like you
were to do it alone...

1052
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,866
the best you'd be able
to come up with

1053
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:49,852
would be a new version of
your Sexy Jutsu, anyway.

1054
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:57,418
It might somehow work out

1055
01:50:57,443 --> 01:51:00,279
if you're a hopeless fool and not
just an ordinary one...

1056
01:51:00,865 --> 01:51:03,549
Be prepared once
you're out of the hospital,

1057
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:05,409
you big fool.

1058
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:08,096
See you then.

1059
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:09,653
Yes!

1060
01:53:03,074 --> 01:53:06,077
<i>It's gotten interesting, hasn't it?</i>

1061
01:53:07,531 --> 01:53:08,449
Yeah...
