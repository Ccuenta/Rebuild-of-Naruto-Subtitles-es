1
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,251
Oh, another shooting star!

2
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,687
Did you make a wish this time?

3
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,396
Oh, I forgot.

4
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,829
What do you mean,
"going out now"?

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,999
Well, the guys are getting together.

6
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
I have to go out sometimes!

7
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,528
"Sometimes"?
It's been every night lately!

8
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,695
I'll be sure to come home early.

9
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,716
Thank you!

10
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,075
Thanks, I'll come again!

11
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,136
Hey! Watch where you're walking.

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,648
Why don't we just do
Rock-Paper-Scissors again tonight?

13
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:08,964
Not that again!
Think of something more exciting!

14
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:10,907
And you call yourself my rival?

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,908
We have an early start tomorrow,
so let's skip it tonight.

16
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:16,933
Don't use a mission
as an excuse!

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,263
I've got all this pent-up energy
inside me!

18
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,458
Now is the time for diligent training!

19
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,352
True discipline and hard work

20
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,512
is what leads to success on missions!

21
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:30,785
Are you listening to me?!

22
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,233
Hey Guy...

23
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:35,170
Do you sense anything weird?

24
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,531
There's a chill in the air.

25
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,850
That's because of your 
unenthusiastic attitude!

26
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,661
We're only young once!

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,483
There's a full moon out tonight, Sasuke.

28
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,953
What...?

29
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,416
What is this sensation?

30
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,889
There, there...

31
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,246
Don't cry, Sasuke.

32
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:18,395
No matter what happens, your big brother
will always protect you...

33
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,690
It can't be...

34
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,163
– What happened?
– Is it an accident?

35
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,500
That's...!

36
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,673
N-No way!

37
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,178
The Nine-Tails!

38
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,678
– Run!
– It's the Nine-Tails!

39
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,055
– Help!
– We're done for!

40
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,204
It's okay. There, there!

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,997
It's the Nine-Tails!

42
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,690
The Demon Fox is loose!

43
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,629
What's going on?!

44
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:34,280
Just run, you idiot!

45
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,152
Sasuke!

46
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,337
It's okay.

47
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,753
You got a little scared, huh?

48
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:07,813
Lord Third Hokage!

49
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,652
The Nine-Tails is...!

50
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,721
The Nine-Tails suddenly
appeared in the village!

51
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:14,949
I know. I'll deal with it.

52
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,892
You and the others protect
the civilians!

53
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,027
Yes sir!

54
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>Has Kushina's seal broken?</i>

55
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,998
<i>Despite all the precautions,
did we fail?</i>

56
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,351
<i>Biwako...</i>

57
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,154
Damn you, Nine-Tails!

58
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,940
This is the moment
I release my pent-up power!

59
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,394
Don't be hasty, Guy!

60
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,505
Come on! I'll be your opponent!

61
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,907
– Wait!
– Huh?

62
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,864
Gather immediately in the guardroom!

63
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:42,849
Why?

64
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,346
It's the Third Hokage's orders!

65
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,160
Lord Hiruzen?

66
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,513
You heard. Let's go, Guy!

67
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,171
Now's our chance!
Evacuate the civilians!

68
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,333
Are we ready?

69
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,260
Yes!

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,097
Over here, Nine-Tails!

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
Over here, Nine-Tails!

72
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
Where are you looking?!

73
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:17,904
Over here.

74
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,488
Do not falter!

75
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,031
Even if we can't defeat the Nine-Tails,

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,478
we must concentrate on
evacuating the villagers!

77
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,873
Do not take action on your own!

78
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,125
Assemble before Lord Hiruzen!

79
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,627
Carry out the orders!

80
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,183
<i>As Hokage,</i>

81
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,128
<i>I will protect the village...
my family...</i>

82
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:44,528
<i>I must do it now.</i>

83
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,674
– Run!
– Help!

84
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,920
Iruka, are you all right?

85
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,122
Mom!

86
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,927
Dad! Mom's...!

87
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,430
Why didn't you stay
at the shelter?

88
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,443
I'll take care of Mom,
so hurry up and get out of here!

89
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:34,824
No, I won't!

90
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,144
I won't leave you
and Mom behind and run away!

91
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,307
I'll protect Mom!

92
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,602
Don't get ahead of yourself,
you're just a kid!

93
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,546
It's a parent's duty to
protect their children!

94
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,245
You must avoid damage
to the village!

95
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,106
Chase the Nine-Tails
outside the village walls!

96
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,332
Yes sir!

97
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,167
Buy me time
to prepare my jutsu!

98
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,837
Do not slow down the attack!

99
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,213
Right! Let's go!

100
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,728
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning!</i>

101
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,858
Come forth... Monkey King Enma!

102
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,633
The Nine-Tails, huh.

103
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,907
So the seal was broken?

104
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:34,053
We'll chase it out of the village 
with the <i>Adamantine Staff</i>!

105
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,735
Got it!
<i>Transform!</i>

106
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,046
Let's go, Enma!

107
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,381
Right!

108
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,109
Extend!

109
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,854
I've chased it out of the village.

110
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:03,119
Don't let up! Keep the pressure on him!

111
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:12,465
Keep him occupied until
the Fourth Hokage arrives!

112
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,746
Iruka...

113
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,582
Let go of me!

114
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:23,320
My dad and my mom are...
still fighting!

115
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,598
The barrier has disappeared!

116
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:50,606
Lord Fourth!

117
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,332
Lady Kushina!

118
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,618
Take her to the Leaf Village Hospital
immediately!

119
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:57,592
Summon the Medical Ninja!

120
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,789
Lord Third...

121
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,475
Kushina...!

122
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,835
Please take care...

123
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,188
of our child.

124
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,133
Of course, you don't need to worry.

125
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,937
His name is...

126
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,136
Naruto...

127
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,581
Minato and I...

128
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,216
picked it from...

129
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,221
Jiraiya-sensei's novel...

130
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:28,741
Naruto, is it? A fine name.
I'll take full responsibility.

131
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:32,394
So, for the child's sake,
you must rest!

132
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,294
Kushina! I promise...

133
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:12,922
Wha—?!

134
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,066
Wha—?!

135
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:15,304
Wha—?!

136
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,893
What is this?!

137
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,622
How terrible!

138
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,195
Who did this?!

139
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,363
Naruto Uzumaki has arrived!

140
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:35,569
I'm gonna be Hokage,
believe it!

141
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,386
Hey!

142
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Come back!

143
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,724
You won't get away with this!

144
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,453
Damn it!
It was him again!

145
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,533
He's made a big mess.

146
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:50,850
Even if we want to file a complaint,

147
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,678
he has no parents
to complain to!

148
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:55,748
What will we do?
Who's going to pay for all this damage?

149
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,855
Who do we complain to?

150
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,554
Was it him again?

151
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,915
Yes, the one
we're not allowed to speak of.

152
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,856
What a nuisance.

153
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,866
– He's so unpleasant.
– Tell me about it.

154
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,267
He's such a pain.

155
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,478
I'm leaving!

156
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,454
You forgot something!

157
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,876
Oops! What'd you make us
for lunch?

158
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,486
Did you put in omelets?

159
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,889
Yes, I put in lots.

160
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,299
– Yes!
– Yes!

161
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:41,467
Be careful now!

162
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,493
– Okay!
– Okay!

163
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,709
Can I come in?

164
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,479
This is for this month's living expenses.

165
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,104
Spend it wisely now.

166
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,767
Hey...

167
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:19,801
Hmm?

168
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,012
Why don't I have a mom and dad?

169
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,095
Didn't I tell you before?

170
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,229
Although it was
quite some time ago...

171
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,173
That's not what I want to hear!

172
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:39,108
You're talking about
when that beast called

173
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,010
the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
went on a rampage, right?

174
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:46,365
And that a lot of people
in the village were killed,

175
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:49,143
including my mom and dad...

176
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:53,615
Well, that's not
what I'm asking about!

177
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:56,306
I just want to know...

178
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,694
Who were my parents?

179
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:00,600
What kind of people were they?

180
00:13:04,842 --> 00:13:07,720
There's no use asking about that.

181
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,456
It won't bring the dead back.

182
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:26,594
I hear it's true.

183
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:28,634
That boy, huh?

184
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,240
Look, isn't that the boy?

185
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:44,701
He gives me the creeps.

186
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,640
Hey, don't play with him.

187
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,557
You don't know what he'll do.

188
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:05,654
Is that right?

189
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,205
Man, that looks good!

190
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,926
Pops, one order of fried rice
and dumplings!

191
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,719
Got it! Coming right up!

192
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,248
Dumplings for me!

193
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:31,274
Gotcha!

194
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:55,646
What a weird kid.

195
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,632
He's the kid...

196
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,754
Did you hear the rumor that
the Fourth Hokage died because of him?

197
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,112
Oh...

198
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,605
I'm home...

199
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,660
Oww...

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:21,997
Oh!

201
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,088
Wow!

202
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,789
Wow!

203
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,447
Seconds please, Mom!

204
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:11,608
Of course.

205
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,403
Big Brother said
you're going somewhere.

206
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,429
When is that?

207
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:18,875
Yes...

208
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,088
We're going to visit
your mother's family.

209
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Oh...

210
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,944
So he told you, did he?

211
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:35,477
I thought we'd go
on my next day off.

212
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:37,557
Would you like to come?

213
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,682
Big Brother's gonna
teach me all kinds of stuff.

214
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:44,290
He said... he'd teach you?

215
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:47,213
Yeah! He promised.

216
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:49,735
Itachi did?

217
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,522
That's unusual!

218
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,627
Here's your rice!

219
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,812
– Oh, can I trouble you for some tea?
– Sure!

220
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,297
Here, Gramps, eat this.

221
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,233
Oh, thank you.

222
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,970
Oh, this looks so good.

223
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:43,573
Well, I caught it.

224
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,311
So of course
it's gonna taste good!

225
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,221
Is that so?

226
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,774
H-Hot!

227
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,776
Look at those stars.

228
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:02,075
Each one of those stars
is like our world's sun.

229
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,064
What do you think?
So many of them... Incredible, isn't it?

230
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:12,593
The sun? That giant thing that
shines in the sky during the day?

231
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,507
Yes. This world is boundless.

232
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,850
Yeah? You sure know a lot, Gramps!

233
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:30,469
Compared to the vastness of the world,
man's existence is very insignificant.

234
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:38,528
Compared to that, the worries
of us humans are so trivial.

235
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:44,961
No kidding. The world is big, huh.

236
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,480
It goes on and on...

237
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:10,015
Want some mushroom soup, Gramps?

238
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:12,977
Are you sure
you can spare me some?

239
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,650
Sure! You tell great stories, Gramps!

240
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,151
I see!

241
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,720
Are you sure these mushrooms
are safe?

242
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,447
We won't know until we eat 'em!

243
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,326
Now you try it, just like that.

244
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,150
You've improved, Sasuke!

245
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,299
I can throw better than Mom now.

246
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:52,456
All right, then how about this?

247
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,667
Huh?

248
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,249
You're amazing, Big Brother!

249
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,336
How did you do that?

250
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,590
You'll start throwing
like that very soon.

251
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,843
You're a lot like me.

252
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,897
Big Brother... Can you teach me
again sometime, like today?

253
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,972
Sure, when I have the time.

254
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,694
Promise?

255
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:43,997
Yeah.

256
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:50,550
Do you know how
the Uchiha Clan came about?

257
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:51,702
What?

258
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,414
I haven't really learned about it
in depth yet.

259
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:01,121
The Uchiha crest is the symbol
and proof of our prestigious clan.

260
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,841
An image of a fan... is prestigious?

261
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,512
You need wind
to start a fire, right?

262
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,306
You produce wind with a fan.

263
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,727
Is that... a great thing?

264
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,607
Well, you'll understand in time.

265
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,319
Big Brother...

266
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,028
Do you fight for
the sake of the clan?

267
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:30,669
I wonder...

268
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:34,585
I'm not sure
about that either just yet.

269
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,673
All right!

270
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,222
I'm gonna make us a feast tonight!

271
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:22,771
Ouch! Hot!

272
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,775
You made all of this?

273
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:28,322
Yeah...

274
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,720
Maybe I went a little overboard.

275
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,901
A little, huh?

276
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,076
I'm stuffed!

277
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,664
Hey, Sasuke...

278
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,750
Want to sleep outside tonight?

279
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:05,430
Are you sure it's okay to do that?

280
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,540
Hey, don't rush!

281
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,225
Oww!

282
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:24,151
Are you cold?

283
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:26,156
Nope... It feels great.

284
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:37,398
I want to become
a skilled shinobi like you,

285
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:39,778
and win Father's approval.

286
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,582
What? Like me?

287
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,878
You will surpass me.

288
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,797
Impossible.

289
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:52,657
No way. I mean, you're gifted.

290
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,136
Everyone says so.

291
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,478
You're a lot like me.

292
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,857
You've got the potential.

293
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,079
Okay then, I'll surpass you!

294
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,545
Sasuke...

295
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,512
Sasuke?

296
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:44,410
Hey, Sakura.

297
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,927
Sakura, aren't those bangs
getting in your way?

298
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,022
You should just cut them!

299
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,219
Oh, don't start, dear!

300
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,477
Girls have their reasons...

301
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,303
If you say things like that,
Sakura will start hating you!

302
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,037
Oh... You like flowers?

303
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:47,622
Who's there?

304
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:52,040
Oh, it's you, Ino.

305
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:54,180
You like cosmos?

306
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,603
Oh...

307
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,885
Uh...

308
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:00,808
Yeah.

309
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:02,808
Take a look!

310
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,167
Ta-dah!

311
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:05,902
Oh, it's so pretty!

312
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:07,217
Isn't it?

313
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,730
I'll tie your hair up with this.

314
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,363
Huh? My hair?

315
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,555
You're cute, Sakura, so...

316
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:25,647
There!

317
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,915
This is way better!

318
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,444
But...

319
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,920
my forehead is...

320
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,422
"Billboard Brow"...

321
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,729
People tease you
because you try to cover it up.

322
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,305
Just show it off.

323
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,828
Then the people around you
will change.

324
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:50,030
But Ino, you're so strong...

325
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,900
Well, I think this is much better.

326
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,780
You've got good style...

327
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,265
I think you should
have more confidence...

328
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,621
I...

329
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,079
I made a friend.

330
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,741
Her name's Ino Yamanaka,

331
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:15,754
and she's cute, strong,
fashionable, and kind...

332
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:19,616
I see.

333
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:22,935
You made a friend, Sakura?

334
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,226
If she's cute,
I'd like to meet her too.

335
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:32,682
Oh, dear...

336
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:34,907
What are you saying!

337
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,026
I'm happy for you, Sakura.

338
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,695
You must cherish your friends.

339
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,451
Friends are precious
assets in life.

340
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,453
Okay!

341
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,652
Ino gave me this ribbon.

342
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,615
It looks great on you.

343
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,748
You're as cute as Mom was
when she was young.

344
00:29:57,237 --> 00:30:01,700
Oh dear... You said I'm cute?

345
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,845
Sakura... while you're at it,
you should find a boyfriend.

346
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:07,438
Come on, Dad!

347
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:21,172
Wow... That's amazing.

348
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:24,062
You did this all by yourself?

349
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:25,881
It's nothing at all!

350
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:31,626
I'm not creative like you.

351
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,501
See this cosmos?

352
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,505
To bring out its beauty,

353
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,615
the things around it
should complement it,

354
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,696
so that they don't clash.

355
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:48,361
All right...

356
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,735
I'm going to rearrange them a bit.

357
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,519
Umm, I'll do this...

358
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,580
And do this...

359
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,983
You know...

360
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,319
... there's a boy I like.

361
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,197
Really? I didn't know.

362
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:08,632
Who is it?

363
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:13,724
Is that why you've been
more cheerful lately?

364
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,957
Okay, all done!

365
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,877
Not really...

366
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,296
but Sasuke...

367
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:24,064
I see...

368
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,384
It's Sasuke?

369
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:30,029
I heard Sasuke likes girls
with long hair.

370
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:31,616
So I was...

371
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,725
Oh, sorry.

372
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,681
I just remembered something.
I'll come again later.

373
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:37,368
Huh? Ino...

374
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:40,859
Thank you for today.

375
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,393
All right, that will do for today.

376
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,251
No, Father...

377
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:25,975
I can still continue!

378
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,075
Neji...

379
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:33,989
You mustn't push yourself too hard.

380
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:38,521
But considering your age,
you've certainly gotten strong.

381
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,558
Father...

382
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:43,398
Thank you for sparring with me.

383
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,768
Oh, Father...

384
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:05,637
I've heard that your older brother
has a child about my age.

385
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,737
Yes... A girl, one year younger than you.

386
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,931
A girl...

387
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,918
We will be going to a celebration
tomorrow for her third birthday.

388
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,453
I wonder what she's like...

389
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:24,379
Father, it's snowing!

390
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,846
The first snow...

391
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,177
It's going to turn into
a heavy snowfall.

392
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,752
Lady Hinata...

393
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,436
Congratulations
on your third birthday.

394
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:53,097
Lady Hinata...

395
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,844
is a cute child.

396
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:57,074
Neji...

397
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,032
It is your destiny to protect her,

398
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:03,799
and to protect
the Hyuga bloodline.

399
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:07,542
The Hyuga... bloodline?

400
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,710
Father!

401
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,188
Neji is very strong.

402
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:51,121
When we were young...

403
00:34:51,146 --> 00:34:53,773
Neji exists to protect Lady Hinata.

404
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:55,917
That is the Hyuga destiny.

405
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,955
All right, that will do for today.

406
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,754
Neji, you are strong indeed.

407
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,077
Hinata, you still have a ways to go.

408
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:15,679
No, my father's daily lessons are...

409
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:20,509
I... don't like...

410
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:22,859
to practice taijutsu.

411
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:24,511
What are you saying?

412
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,268
You are the heir of the Hyuga clan.

413
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:31,781
You must be more positive
and confident.

414
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,859
I wish I could switch places with you,
Big Brother Neji...

415
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,930
You are very strong, after all.

416
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:42,673
No, you must never say
such a thing.

417
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:45,593
I will make you strong!

418
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,164
When you are in danger,
I will give my life to protect you!

419
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,689
Big Brother Neji!

420
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,988
Lady Hinata, it's snowing!

421
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:04,190
I had a snowball fight with my father
this morning, and I hit him twice!

422
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,244
Um... um...

423
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:31,477
Of those three symbols, the one on the
right belongs to the Akimichi Clan, right?

424
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:33,791
The rest are, um...

425
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,740
The one in the middle
signifies the Nara Clan.

426
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,050
The one on the left
is the Yamanaka Clan.

427
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,474
Three clans that use
highly unusual Secret Jutsu.

428
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,847
We've been combining our
powers for many generations

429
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,343
and our three clans share
a special relationship.

430
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,826
To strengthen unity
and protect our clans,

431
00:36:52,851 --> 00:37:00,221
the esteemed Sarutobi Clan bestows
ear piercings upon all three of our clans.

432
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:04,777
Generation upon generation has sworn
an oath of loyalty on these earrings.

433
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,565
This is it, right?

434
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:10,063
The other clan heads wear one too.

435
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,696
Piercing your ear must hurt, though.

436
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:18,097
The ear is pierced so that
the message goes deep down.

437
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,897
So that one never forgets the oath.

438
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:22,918
In time, you will also pierce your ear.

439
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:24,936
What?! Why?

440
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,952
When a child becomes a Genin,

441
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:30,940
it is customary for the parent to
pass on his earring to the child

442
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:33,084
until he attains Chunin rank.

443
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:38,105
It's a ritual to teach one's child
about weight of those oaths!

444
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,844
I don't like pain...

445
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:51,998
Hizashi!

446
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:53,541
He's only four...

447
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,503
It's such a pity...

448
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:09,440
Big Brother Neji...

449
00:39:02,562 --> 00:39:04,898
What are you doing?!

450
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,621
What are you doing here?

451
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,627
If you keep crying,
how am I supposed to find out?

452
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:19,699
I... I...

453
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:29,302
Where's your house?

454
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,809
Oh well, come on.

455
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,207
Let's go.

456
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:53,193
You live in a big house like this,

457
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:55,261
and you're crying?

458
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,669
Even though I'm all alone, I'd never cry!

459
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,575
Never!

460
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:15,692
Later!

461
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:21,593
Hinata!

462
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,738
You are the precious heir
to the Head Family!

463
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:29,098
What do you think you're doing?!

464
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:30,740
I...

465
00:40:31,491 --> 00:40:34,827
For your sake, and for the sake
of the Head Family,

466
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,882
many people have made
the ultimate sacrifice.

467
00:40:39,023 --> 00:40:42,693
It's about time you learned
about these things...

468
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:01,767
Here I go!

469
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,413
Bombs away!

470
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,630
Bull's eye!

471
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:12,991
Red-Nosed Hokage, complete!

472
00:41:15,747 --> 00:41:17,415
He is incorrigible.

473
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:21,967
Lord Third,
please let me think about this.

474
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,470
About becoming
Naruto's homeroom teacher.

475
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:28,231
As you can see, Iruka,

476
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:31,175
everyone is troubled by
Naruto's mischief.

477
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:35,471
And his pranks are
getting worse each day.

478
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,526
No one wants to take him.

479
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:43,730
I believe a teacher's job is
to enhance a student's virtues.

480
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:51,645
If Naruto does not graduate
from the Academy,

481
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,798
he will not be able to
become a ninja.

482
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:57,672
He will remain an outcast in
this village for the rest of his life.

483
00:41:57,697 --> 00:42:00,304
Just a minute... I'm sure there's
someone else better suited for Naruto.

484
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,749
If Naruto cannot get a teacher,
then I have no choice

485
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:05,694
but to have him leave
the Academy.

486
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:12,925
Don't let it bother you.
No one can blame you.

487
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:16,721
And even if that happens,
it certainly isn't your fault.

488
00:42:16,846 --> 00:42:18,388
Please wait.

489
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,142
What? Then you'll accept?

490
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,770
Uh... Err... Yes.

491
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:26,481
Oh... Is that so?

492
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:30,604
This is a lifesaver for Naruto.

493
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:42,080
Keep wiping until every speck
of graffiti is gone!

494
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:45,166
Oh look... It's that <i>thing</i>.

495
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,960
Why do we let that boy
stay in this village?

496
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:51,214
I wish Lord Hokage would have
more consideration for us.

497
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:53,716
Shut up!

498
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,593
Hey! Come back!

499
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:59,010
I'm not "that thing"!

500
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:01,221
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

501
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,749
I'm gonna be Hokage someday!

502
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:25,039
<i>It's just a dream...</i>

503
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:01,931
That's right!

504
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm supposed to get
a new homeroom teacher today.

505
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,915
The first impression is important.

506
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,717
I should give him a proper greeting.

507
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,300
- 'Morning!
- Hi!

508
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,406
Who did this?!

509
00:44:36,281 --> 00:44:37,681
Of all the mischief...

510
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:49,265
Gotcha! Gotcha!

511
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:52,094
The eraser was just a decoy.

512
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:54,920
Naruto!

513
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:57,072
I know, I know.
I'll go stand in the hallway.

514
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:01,068
No, go and take your seat.

515
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:01,915
Huh?

516
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:09,076
What a letdown.

517
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:12,371
I was looking forward to
seeing Naruto get yelled at.

518
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:15,188
Sheesh! How boring...

519
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,093
'Morning!

520
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,329
First, let me introduce myself!

521
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:25,117
I'll be your homeroom teacher
starting today.

522
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,452
I'm Iruka Umino.

523
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:29,326
My favorite food is Ichiraku Ramen.

524
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:31,849
My least favorite food
is mixed rice.

525
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,436
My birthday is May 26th.

526
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:37,296
My hobbies include
going to the hot springs...

527
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:41,842
Therefore, one's chakra
is greatly influenced

528
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,535
by their mental energy.

529
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:53,729
Huh?

530
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:57,466
Sensei... Class time is over.

531
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:01,529
See? Look.

532
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,873
Oh, it's that time already.

533
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:10,551
Well then, that's all for today.

534
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:24,510
How's that for Naruto's third prank?

535
00:46:25,094 --> 00:46:26,178
See!

536
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:31,434
Owww...

537
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,602
You found out already?

538
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:35,597
Return to your seat.

539
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:38,024
Let's continue the lesson.

540
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,409
Okay then...
Instead of self-introductions,

541
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:51,203
I want each of you to demonstrate
your ninjutsu skill!

542
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,636
You're not going to be graded.

543
00:46:57,266 --> 00:47:01,603
This is just so I can assess how
to proceed with our lessons.

544
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:07,200
So... We'll do a basic jutsu:
the Clone Jutsu.

545
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:10,617
Umm... First up is Sasuke Uchiha.

546
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,947
- Go ahead and try it.
- Sasuke!

547
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,522
Clone Jutsu is child's play.

548
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:24,320
You always act so smug!

549
00:47:24,528 --> 00:47:26,447
Shut up, idiot.

550
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:29,116
Don't interrupt Sasuke's focus!

551
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:31,285
That's right! You're in the way!

552
00:47:31,535 --> 00:47:34,039
Not you too, Sakura.

553
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:36,957
Okay, Sasuke. Try it.

554
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,171
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

555
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:46,175
Hmm...

556
00:47:46,592 --> 00:47:50,054
Amazing!
That was a perfect Clone Jutsu.

557
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:52,223
I can't tell which one is real.

558
00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:55,530
It's so obvious to me!

559
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:56,954
This one!

560
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:58,354
Wrong.

561
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,255
H-Huh?!

562
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:04,416
- Stupid! Hey, that's the real one.
- What are you doing?!

563
00:48:07,615 --> 00:48:08,950
Wrong again.

564
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:12,775
Sasuke!

565
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:18,807
Amazing, two clones in an instant
while the real one moved elsewhere.

566
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,169
Humph! I can do Clone Jutsu too!

567
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:24,099
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

568
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:33,472
This guy's such an idiot!

569
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:34,879
<i>Damn it...</i>

570
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:40,203
I don't know what your problem is,
but stop lunging at me.

571
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:41,809
He's right.

572
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,875
I say that because every time
you do something,

573
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,210
you hold up our lesson.

574
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:47,670
And that is an annoyance.

575
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:48,816
What?!

576
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:51,594
Yeah, you're an annoyance!

577
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:53,909
You're a germ just for being alive!

578
00:48:54,127 --> 00:48:56,129
That's cruel, Hibachi.

579
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:58,075
But he's right!

580
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,322
What?!

581
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:02,293
Everyone! Quit making fun of Naruto!

582
00:49:03,419 --> 00:49:04,411
Sensei!

583
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:10,326
Don't bother... with this kid.

584
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:11,844
Huh?

585
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:25,062
C'mon, everyone.
Let's continue our lesson.

586
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,505
- Okay.
- Okay.

587
00:49:26,942 --> 00:49:29,278
- Let's go.
- I'm gonna do my best.

588
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,732
Big Sister Hinata!

589
00:50:03,198 --> 00:50:04,525
I've been waiting for you!

590
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,964
Let's play ninja!

591
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:12,077
I'm sorry, Hanabi.
I can't right now.

592
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:15,352
Huh? Come on,
just for a little while!

593
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:17,046
That will not do, Lady Hanabi.

594
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,148
Lady Hinata must train
with Lord Hiashi.

595
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,271
I will play with you.

596
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,977
Please be on your way.

597
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:28,337
I'll see you later, Hanabi.

598
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:33,431
No, no! Big Sister!

599
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:42,017
It's so boring...

600
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,419
It can't be helped.

601
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:48,005
Her ladyship is the heir
of the Head Family.

602
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:51,100
But just a little can't hurt...

603
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:54,697
We Hyuga are an illustrious clan
within the Hidden Leaf,

604
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:58,893
who possess the Byakugan,
the most renowned of all Kekkei Genkai.

605
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:01,633
As the leader of the clan,

606
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,036
there is a mountain of knowledge
that Lady Hinata must learn.

607
00:51:05,276 --> 00:51:06,705
Here you go.

608
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:25,100
Lady Hanabi!

609
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,729
Lady Hanabi!

610
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:33,104
Now where did she run off to?

611
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:42,995
I found Big Sister!

612
00:52:00,308 --> 00:52:03,508
I didn't get to play
with Big Sister today...

613
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:11,906
Big Sister Hinata!

614
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:14,026
Sorry I'm late.

615
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:16,619
No problem!

616
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:27,710
Huh?

617
00:52:53,732 --> 00:52:54,942
Damn it!

618
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:57,165
I'm gonna pulverize him today
for sure...

619
00:52:57,824 --> 00:52:59,190
Y'know!

620
00:53:03,524 --> 00:53:04,677
Damn it! Damn it!

621
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:06,422
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!

622
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:14,568
Oh man! Oh man!

623
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:19,007
Even Choji?!

624
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:27,015
Damn it!

625
00:53:27,373 --> 00:53:28,717
Definitely today!

626
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:30,906
Definitely today!

627
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:34,398
Definitely today!

628
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:38,095
It'll be Naruto Uzumaki
versus Sasuke Uchiha.

629
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,971
Come on, you idiot!

630
00:53:40,155 --> 00:53:44,108
Naruto! Make the proper sign for sparring!

631
00:53:44,675 --> 00:53:46,085
It's part of the etiquette!

632
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:48,038
Who cares about that!

633
00:53:48,306 --> 00:53:50,560
Hurry up and
let me beat this guy!

634
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:53,644
I'm finally going to become popular!

635
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:55,830
What a waste of time...

636
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,271
I'll make it quick,
just like you want.

637
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:58,790
Hold on, you two!

638
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:00,275
For crying out loud...

639
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,998
Shinobi hand-to-hand combat
is a traditional training method

640
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:04,889
passed down through
the generations.

641
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:07,548
It might be stuffy etiquette,

642
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:09,744
but here at the Academy
we start with the basics.

643
00:54:09,753 --> 00:54:11,197
It matters!

644
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:16,202
You always start by showing
your opponent a one-handed sign,

645
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,177
which represents half of the two hands
used when unleashing a jutsu,

646
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,299
and displays your
intention to fight!

647
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,794
This is called the
"Seal of Confrontation".

648
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:28,323
After the sparring is done
and the victor is decided,

649
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,880
both partners present
the Seal of Confrontation again,

650
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:37,227
then bring their hands together to form the
"Seal of Reconciliation" as a show of friendship.

651
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:40,647
This is the etiquette of
hand-to-hand combat.

652
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:43,253
Are you listening, Naruto?!

653
00:54:43,336 --> 00:54:45,222
This is the second time
I've explained it to you!

654
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:46,372
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:48,986
One "yes" is sufficient, you idiot.

656
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:50,567
I get it.

657
00:54:56,245 --> 00:54:56,945
N-Naru—

658
00:54:56,953 --> 00:54:59,039
Pound him, Sasuke!

659
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:04,773
Start!

660
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,865
Amazing! He's so cool!

661
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,116
Sasuke, you're terrific!

662
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:19,791
<i>This guy...</i>

663
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:23,210
<i>That look in his eyes...</i>

664
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:26,845
<i>It's the same look that
everyone gives me.</i>

665
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:28,758
<i>No...</i>

666
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,977
<i>It's stronger than that.</i>

667
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:34,680
<i>But...</i>

668
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,188
<i>But it's not for me...</i>

669
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:48,318
He pisses me off!

670
00:55:49,736 --> 00:55:53,824
I'm gonna show all of them!
I swear!

671
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:56,034
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

672
00:55:58,637 --> 00:55:59,429
Wha-?

673
00:56:02,118 --> 00:56:04,412
Damn it! Once more!

674
00:56:12,392 --> 00:56:14,060
<i>N-Naruto...</i>

675
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:22,608
What's the matter, Naruto?

676
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:24,278
Nothing...

677
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:26,678
Want some ramen?

678
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:29,531
No thanks... I got no money.

679
00:56:29,901 --> 00:56:31,695
You can pay me back
when you're rich.

680
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,805
Besides, the grill's still hot.

681
00:56:34,555 --> 00:56:35,502
Really?

682
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:36,860
Yeah...

683
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,068
All right!

684
00:56:40,954 --> 00:56:43,415
You seem depressed.
Something wrong?

685
00:56:43,524 --> 00:56:45,082
No, it's nothing!

686
00:56:45,404 --> 00:56:47,072
I'm my usual self!

687
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:12,951
All right. Today, we'll do hands-on
practice of Shuriken Jutsu.

688
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:16,897
Let's have someone
demonstrate it for us first.

689
00:57:17,675 --> 00:57:18,714
Let's see...

690
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,813
- Me! Me! Me!
- I can do it!

691
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:23,215
- Leave it to me.
- I'll do it in one try!

692
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,534
- Me! Me! Me!
- I can do it!

693
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,143
Shino, go ahead!

694
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:32,214
Iruka-sensei,
you chose the wrong person.

695
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:36,166
The reason is, for all forms of warfare,

696
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:37,901
the Aburame Clan relies greatly

697
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:41,740
on the parasitic insects
we house in our bodies.

698
00:57:41,765 --> 00:57:43,565
And the Shuriken Jutsu
is simply not in our...

699
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,035
Okay, enough!

700
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:47,354
Sasuke, show us the basics.

701
00:57:48,605 --> 00:57:54,069
- Sasuke!
- Do your best! Go for it!

702
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:58,256
Sheesh! That Sasuke is always
so arrogant!

703
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,908
So how come he's so popular?!

704
00:58:08,979 --> 00:58:11,189
Hmm... Well done, Sasuke.

705
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:14,058
- All right, Sasuke!
- You're so cool!

706
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:19,845
Hmph! Show-off! I can do that too!

707
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:22,806
Then Naruto, you're next.

708
00:58:23,056 --> 00:58:24,182
All right!

709
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:26,513
I'll show you!

710
00:58:34,756 --> 00:58:40,095
<i>I'll nail this in one shot, and make
everyone acknowledge me.</i>

711
00:58:42,701 --> 00:58:43,702
Go!

712
00:58:55,638 --> 00:58:58,599
Are you kidding me?
Every single one missed!

713
00:59:00,427 --> 00:59:02,470
I was just fooling around!

714
00:59:07,229 --> 00:59:10,551
Sensei! One more time!
Please, just let try one more time!

715
00:59:10,952 --> 00:59:11,913
I'll get serious this time.

716
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:13,440
No, that's enough.

717
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:17,816
Okay, who's next?

718
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:24,192
Hey!

719
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:25,160
It's that kid again!

720
00:59:25,185 --> 00:59:26,811
That brat!

721
00:59:27,913 --> 00:59:29,831
Damn it, where did he go?!

722
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:31,082
Over there!

723
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:36,360
Serves you right!

724
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:23,259
Did you hear?

725
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,345
The entire Uchiha Clan was wiped out.

726
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:29,224
Yeah, I know.
I heard my dad talking about it.

727
01:00:29,266 --> 01:00:31,434
He's the only one who survived.

728
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:50,328
- Let's go!
- Okay!

729
01:00:52,174 --> 01:00:55,052
Hey guys. What are you all doing?

730
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:57,665
What? Stay away, Naruto.

731
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:00,208
Why? Why can't I?

732
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:03,211
Let me play with you guys too.

733
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,176
Why should we?!

734
01:01:05,353 --> 01:01:08,105
There's no way you're coming with us
for tonight's test of courage.

735
01:01:08,336 --> 01:01:09,629
Test of courage?

736
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:11,108
Ow!

737
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:12,885
What are you babbling about?

738
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:15,520
Wow, sounds like fun!

739
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:16,980
I'm coming too!

740
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:19,357
We told you, you can't!

741
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:21,609
Get this!
Don't you dare follow us!

742
01:01:22,173 --> 01:01:23,174
Come on!

743
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:41,035
<i>Get this! You better not follow us!</i>

744
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:45,061
Hey, is that the boy?

745
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,510
Yes... That's the one.

746
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:00,514
You brat!

747
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:01,608
Huh?

748
01:02:01,754 --> 01:02:03,047
Go away!

749
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:08,427
Big Sister came yesterday.

750
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:11,350
She must have been exhausted
from all that training.

751
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,980
Did you thank her properly?

752
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,803
Well... She was already asleep,
so I'll thank her next time!

753
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:21,292
Yes, please do that.

754
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,963
What's the big idea?!

755
01:02:24,881 --> 01:02:28,093
What are you doing here?!
You're nothing but a pest!

756
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:31,410
What? I was only...

757
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,799
I was only looking at the masks!

758
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:35,275
You want this?

759
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:38,076
You little brat!

760
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:41,168
You disgust me.
Just take it!

761
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:48,075
You can have it.
Now get lost!

762
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,853
Hey, Natsu, who is that boy?

763
01:02:54,994 --> 01:02:55,995
Well...

764
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,625
It's as the shopkeeper said.

765
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:03,545
What?!

766
01:03:04,426 --> 01:03:07,924
Why does everyone look at me like that?

767
01:03:10,144 --> 01:03:13,523
You must never approach him.

768
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:24,441
You're going to your studies?

769
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:25,354
Yeah!

770
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:27,652
I can write my name now.

771
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:29,070
I even know some kanji!

772
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,041
Actually lots!

773
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:32,130
Really?

774
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:35,468
Lady Hinata, you mustn't keep
Lord Hiashi waiting.

775
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:36,377
Right.

776
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:39,026
I'll see you later, Hanabi.

777
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:39,898
Okay!

778
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,002
Training, huh...

779
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:01,199
Please focus.

780
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,705
You can't go out to play
unless you finish.

781
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:12,529
Done! Here!

782
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:19,871
My, my...

783
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:38,522
<i>So strong... yet so kind.</i>

784
01:04:38,736 --> 01:04:40,655
<i>I want to be like her...</i>

785
01:04:50,735 --> 01:04:54,030
<i>I want to be more like my sister,
even just a little.</i>

786
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:05,083
Big Brother Neji?

787
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:08,308
Her sparring partner
doesn't have to be me.

788
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:10,479
Please let me do my own training.

789
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,796
No, not yet. Continue.

790
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:16,618
Please, let's continue, Neji.

791
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:22,569
Understood.

792
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:33,371
<i>That guy's different today...</i>

793
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,303
What's wrong, Lady Hinata?

794
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,503
This isn't a game.

795
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:50,254
<i>Hang in there, Big Sister!</i>

796
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:53,757
<i>That's so...</i>

797
01:05:54,966 --> 01:05:56,593
That was nothing...

798
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:01,890
And with this, you expect to fulfill
your destiny...

799
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:04,767
As the leader of the Hyuga Clan?

800
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:25,685
What?

801
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:29,250
Argh... My head... My head...!

802
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:45,089
The fool...

803
01:06:47,013 --> 01:06:48,181
<i>What's... going on?</i>

804
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:49,589
What was that?

805
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:29,602
<i>What is she doing
in a place like this...?</i>

806
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,081
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

807
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:50,034
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

808
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:52,522
<i>Isn't that the boy...?</i>

809
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,678
<i>Why is Big Sister watching him?</i>

810
01:07:57,338 --> 01:07:58,589
<i>Big Sister?</i>

811
01:08:37,754 --> 01:08:38,755
I'm entering.

812
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:05,548
Sheesh, you're all wimps.

813
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:08,954
No one's brave enough
to go all the way in?

814
01:09:10,642 --> 01:09:11,976
Don't say that...

815
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:13,836
Well then, I'll go.

816
01:09:25,881 --> 01:09:27,633
This is easy.

817
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:34,884
All I have to do is take that branch.

818
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:47,840
A fox demon!

819
01:09:52,998 --> 01:09:54,499
Huh? What's going on?!

820
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:55,775
A fox demon!

821
01:09:55,998 --> 01:09:57,166
What?!

822
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,738
Serves them right.

823
01:10:17,774 --> 01:10:19,859
Everyone got scared and ran off.

824
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:23,302
You better run, Sensei,
or I'll eat you up!

825
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:31,839
<i>Bad news! The advance team
has been defeated!</i>

826
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:34,492
<i>What?! Then the advance team
is... wiped out?!</i>

827
01:10:34,745 --> 01:10:37,331
<i>The advance team... All of them?</i>

828
01:10:38,145 --> 01:10:39,396
<i>It can't be true...</i>

829
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:46,330
<i>It can't be true...
My mom and dad...</i>

830
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:48,406
<i>they wouldn't die!</i>

831
01:10:53,168 --> 01:10:55,087
Huh? What's up, Sensei?

832
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:02,003
Naruto... Do you realize
what you're doing?

833
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,969
Why? Why?!

834
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:17,038
Why does everyone, even you,
my teacher...?

835
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:20,024
Why do you all look at me like that?!

836
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:25,022
I'm not a pest and I'm not some germ!

837
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:29,750
I'm... I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

838
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:30,924
Hey!

839
01:11:46,325 --> 01:11:47,659
Good morning, everyone!

840
01:11:47,858 --> 01:11:49,944
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

841
01:11:50,274 --> 01:11:52,193
All right, let me take attendance.

842
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,918
Naruto's not here?

843
01:11:58,649 --> 01:11:59,650
Sakura.

844
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:01,099
Do you know?

845
01:12:01,322 --> 01:12:04,283
Oh... I didn't notice.

846
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,890
Oh yeah, I don't think
I saw him this morning.

847
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:08,530
Kiba, have you seen him?

848
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:10,641
Huh? Nope.

849
01:12:10,867 --> 01:12:14,579
Besides, I have no interest in him.
Right, Akamaru?

850
01:12:16,614 --> 01:12:17,615
Fine then.

851
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,711
Let's begin our class.

852
01:12:22,584 --> 01:12:23,960
<i>But, why?</i>

853
01:12:24,076 --> 01:12:26,745
<i>Lord Hokage is performing
official duties right now.</i>

854
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,437
<i>Why won't the Third Hokage
agree to see me?</i>

855
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:31,983
<i>That's not our concern.</i>

856
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:34,844
<i>We have our orders.
No one is permitted to enter.</i>

857
01:12:41,585 --> 01:12:42,627
Hey, hey!

858
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,599
You know, this is my special seat.

859
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:50,949
I can't concentrate on my reading

860
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:54,082
when someone's sighing 
that loudly next to me.

861
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:56,819
Oh... I'm sorry. I'll move away now.

862
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:00,976
No, wait. I was just about to leave.

863
01:13:03,054 --> 01:13:04,055
Be seeing you...

864
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:12,163
What's wrong?
You look so depressed.

865
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:15,193
If you feel like talking, I'll listen.

866
01:13:22,221 --> 01:13:23,973
- Kakashi...
- Hmm?

867
01:13:24,347 --> 01:13:25,557
That's your name, right?

868
01:13:27,672 --> 01:13:30,967
Well, I happen to be Naruto's...
you know the one...

869
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:33,655
I'm Naruto Uzumaki's homeroom teacher.

870
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:35,577
I see...

871
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:39,975
But I went to ask
the Third Hokage to relieve me

872
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,879
as his homeroom teacher.

873
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:45,545
Lord Hokage wouldn't see me.

874
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:49,149
I just don't know how...

875
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:52,177
I don't know how to deal with Naruto.

876
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:56,121
I'm not qualified to teach Naruto!

877
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,559
Perhaps you've forgotten
a basic rule of teaching.

878
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,482
"One cannot open the hearts of
others if one's own heart is closed."

879
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,944
Or perhaps you're trying to forget.

880
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:13,061
The Nine-Tails sealed inside
of Naruto is responsible

881
01:14:13,086 --> 01:14:15,297
for the death of my parents.

882
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,746
I'm fully aware that Naruto
is not to blame.

883
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:22,431
But whenever I see him,

884
01:14:22,456 --> 01:14:27,919
I can't help but see
the Nine-Tails sealed inside of him.

885
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:32,286
I don't think Naruto would
open up to someone like me.

886
01:14:33,286 --> 01:14:36,266
You are the only one
who can open Naruto's heart.

887
01:14:38,017 --> 01:14:38,931
That...

888
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:42,762
That is your ordeal.

889
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,304
Trial?!

890
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:46,920
Yes, one that Lord Hokage
has given you.

891
01:14:47,304 --> 01:14:52,726
Just hang in there a little longer,
and you will find the way.

892
01:14:53,492 --> 01:14:55,953
Rise up to his expectations.

893
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,743
See you.

894
01:15:10,971 --> 01:15:13,307
<i>Third Hokage sure made
a bold decision.</i>

895
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:26,586
Koji! Time to go home!

896
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,858
- Daichi! Dinnertime!
- Okay.

897
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,610
Let's go home, everyone.

898
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,153
Mom!

899
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:38,742
What are you doing?
I told you not to play with that boy.

900
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,494
Come on, let's go!

901
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:48,435
Shikamaru, let's go!

902
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,461
Oh, Dad...

903
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:53,405
Choji's with you?

904
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,022
We'll walk him home. Let's go.

905
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,064
- See you, Naruto.
- Bye.

906
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:00,514
Y-Yeah.

907
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,607
Dad! Let go of my hand!

908
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,153
What's there to be embarrassed about?

909
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:31,456
Thank you for the food.

910
01:18:02,432 --> 01:18:06,937
<i>Let me go! My Mom and Dad
are still out there fighting!</i>

911
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,061
Damn it!

912
01:18:41,251 --> 01:18:43,044
Ow...

913
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:48,118
Who is it... so early in the morning?

914
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:06,741
What?! Iruka-sensei?!
What's he doing here?!

915
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:29,817
Naruto!

916
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,314
Naruto! I'm coming in.

917
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:46,437
<i>This is all he eats?</i>

918
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,078
Thank you for the food.

919
01:19:52,582 --> 01:19:54,182
You're going to stop at
Choji's house, aren't you?

920
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:55,208
Hurry up and eat, then.

921
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:56,692
Yeah...

922
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,837
Say Dad? Can I ask you something?

923
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,914
What is it?

924
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:06,009
Why does everyone avoid Naruto
like he has the plague?

925
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,479
Did he do something wrong?

926
01:20:12,026 --> 01:20:15,321
Shikamaru... How do you feel
about that boy?

927
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:21,264
H-How do I feel?
Well, I never thought about it.

928
01:20:23,234 --> 01:20:26,321
He's an idiot, but he's a funny guy.

929
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:30,617
It's not like I want to be his best friend,
but I don't avoid him either.

930
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:32,175
I see...

931
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:36,206
Then you should do what
you want to do.

932
01:20:36,752 --> 01:20:39,003
Yeah, I guess so.

933
01:20:51,651 --> 01:20:53,945
I knew I'd find you here.

934
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:58,565
Hey, Shikamaru.
Can you lend me some money?

935
01:20:59,185 --> 01:21:02,021
Why? Snacks again?

936
01:21:02,522 --> 01:21:03,690
Yeah!

937
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:08,087
I mean... what else is there
to buy besides snacks?

938
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:10,731
Aw man, what a drag.

939
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:14,040
You're one in a million.

940
01:21:26,397 --> 01:21:27,690
What's with your eyes?

941
01:21:27,863 --> 01:21:29,042
So creepy!

942
01:21:29,067 --> 01:21:30,485
Don't look at us!

943
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,262
You're weird.

944
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:35,033
C'mon, cut it out!

945
01:21:35,366 --> 01:21:37,399
What'd she do to you anyway?!

946
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:40,552
What? Trying to act like a hero?

947
01:21:42,413 --> 01:21:44,665
Stop bullying someone weaker
than you!

948
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,360
Shut up!

949
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,533
Humph! This is boring!

950
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:55,179
Let's go, guys.

951
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:56,870
So boring.

952
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,663
– Let's go.
– Yeah, let's go.

953
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:03,728
Man, what a drag.
Getting involved in stuff like that.

954
01:22:04,338 --> 01:22:06,465
Instead of butting into
other people's business,

955
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,826
he should polish his skills.

956
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,550
Stupid Naruto.

957
01:22:13,132 --> 01:22:14,425
Don't call him "stupid."

958
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:15,988
Huh? What?

959
01:22:17,387 --> 01:22:19,305
Naruto is not stupid.

960
01:22:19,965 --> 01:22:22,488
Even you said before, Shikamaru...

961
01:22:22,513 --> 01:22:25,268
You said all shogi pieces
are necessary.

962
01:22:25,847 --> 01:22:27,115
You said that about me.

963
01:22:27,346 --> 01:22:30,433
Huh?! What are you talking about?

964
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:33,632
You're just mad at me
from earlier

965
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,367
because I wouldn't lend you
any money.

966
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:39,402
You're wrong.

967
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:41,452
Naruto is...

968
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:43,955
Naruto is like you, Shikamaru!

969
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:46,711
So don't call him "stupid"!
Take it back!

970
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:48,459
Sheesh!

971
01:22:48,895 --> 01:22:50,396
What a drag!

972
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:53,363
Then speak in a way
I can understand!

973
01:22:55,788 --> 01:22:56,831
Don't...

974
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:59,105
Don't order me around!

975
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:02,280
Hey, hey!

976
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,229
What are you guys doing?!

977
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:06,251
You're friends, aren't you?

978
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:08,274
Why are you fighting?!

979
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,584
Hey!

980
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,610
This...

981
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,516
This fatso started it!

982
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,659
It's because you're blind!

983
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,411
I'm not a fatso!

984
01:23:23,414 --> 01:23:24,916
I'm just big-boned!

985
01:23:27,107 --> 01:23:28,233
All right!

986
01:23:29,268 --> 01:23:30,770
Then, let me in on this fight.

987
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:32,692
Huh...?

988
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,046
– What are you talking about?
– What are you talking about?

989
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:40,199
Oh! Then I'll use the money
you pay me to buy snacks!

990
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:41,580
– What?
– Huh?

991
01:23:42,795 --> 01:23:43,921
What did you just say?

992
01:23:55,956 --> 01:23:57,708
I did that...

993
01:23:58,071 --> 01:24:00,909
and then, I went
to the usual spot.

994
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,159
Huh, so that's what happened.

995
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,244
Naruto, want some snacks?

996
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:09,210
Oh, thank you!

997
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:17,266
Hey, look!

998
01:24:42,383 --> 01:24:44,051
What? Seriously?

999
01:24:44,076 --> 01:24:45,160
What a drag!

1000
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,581
– Nope, nope.
– Nope, nope.

1001
01:24:46,606 --> 01:24:48,065
– No girls for me!
– No girls for me!

1002
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,819
– She's after us!
– She's after us!

1003
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:53,630
Over here!

1004
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:55,011
You wait!

1005
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:03,139
I can't go any further!

1006
01:25:03,806 --> 01:25:04,891
Ino's coming! Keep running!

1007
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,685
I can't!

1008
01:25:16,171 --> 01:25:20,467
That Ino...
She's terrible when she gets mad!

1009
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,191
I swear she's gonna end up
an old maid.

1010
01:25:27,877 --> 01:25:29,378
See ya later, Naruto.

1011
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,584
Your Sexy Jutsu was awesome!

1012
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,300
Bye-bye, Naruto!

1013
01:25:35,188 --> 01:25:36,606
Hey, hey, Shikamaru.

1014
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:39,271
It's curry night at my house tonight.

1015
01:25:39,317 --> 01:25:40,109
That sounds good!

1016
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:42,639
I'm getting tired of
my mom's cooking.

1017
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:47,938
See you tomorrow!

1018
01:25:47,975 --> 01:25:49,143
Yeah!

1019
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,478
See ya tomorrow!

1020
01:26:03,377 --> 01:26:04,378
Hey, Naruto!

1021
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:06,570
Why would you do such a thing?!

1022
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:08,938
You're really gonna get it this time!

1023
01:26:14,644 --> 01:26:15,978
I don't care!

1024
01:26:16,879 --> 01:26:18,381
You know your problem?

1025
01:26:18,828 --> 01:26:21,038
You can't do the things I do!

1026
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,885
Only I can do this!

1027
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:25,336
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!

1028
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:26,827
There's a problem, sir!

1029
01:26:26,864 --> 01:26:27,864
Lord Hokage!

1030
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,626
What is it?

1031
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:33,238
Did that Naruto do something again?

1032
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,587
Yes. He climbed onto
the mountainside images...

1033
01:26:36,857 --> 01:26:38,984
And he vandalized them!
He graffitied all over them!

1034
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,162
Wait!

1035
01:26:54,023 --> 01:26:55,024
Ha ha...

1036
01:26:55,522 --> 01:26:57,375
Why should I?

1037
01:26:58,004 --> 01:26:59,088
Hey, Naruto!

1038
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:07,013
How did you suddenly get here,
Iruka-sensei?

1039
01:27:07,246 --> 01:27:10,086
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?

1040
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:14,178
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.

1041
01:27:15,008 --> 01:27:17,719
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.

1042
01:27:18,523 --> 01:27:20,859
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.

1043
01:27:21,272 --> 01:27:22,624
<i>Oh no...</i>

1044
01:27:22,966 --> 01:27:26,865
<i>Of all the jutsus...! That's 
the my worst one!</i>

1045
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:34,332
<i>But still...
I will do it no matter what!</i>

1046
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,005
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

1047
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:51,557
Disqualified!

1048
01:27:53,748 --> 01:27:54,748
Iruka-sensei.

1049
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,662
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.

1050
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:03,337
And he managed to come up
with something.

1051
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,793
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?

1052
01:28:06,379 --> 01:28:11,468
Mizuki-sensei... All the others
created three or more clones.

1053
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:14,881
Naruto created just one.

1054
01:28:15,409 --> 01:28:19,622
And it's completely useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.

1055
01:28:26,323 --> 01:28:28,203
I'm a ninja now!

1056
01:28:28,534 --> 01:28:30,328
You did well. That's my son.

1057
01:28:30,789 --> 01:28:32,374
Congratulations on your graduation!

1058
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:34,203
I'll cook something good tonight!

1059
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:37,311
Look at that one.

1060
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:41,717
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.

1061
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:44,157
Serves him right.

1062
01:28:44,436 --> 01:28:46,980
Imagine what would happen
if he became a ninja.

1063
01:28:47,341 --> 01:28:48,551
Isn't that boy actually...

1064
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:51,120
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that...

1065
01:28:54,827 --> 01:28:59,582
Iruka.
We need to talk later.

1066
01:29:00,358 --> 01:29:01,689
Yes, sir.

1067
01:29:06,212 --> 01:29:10,049
Iruka-sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.

1068
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:13,019
Then why just me?

1069
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:19,275
He says he wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.

1070
01:29:20,332 --> 01:29:21,792
You both don't have parents.

1071
01:29:23,634 --> 01:29:27,430
But I really wanted to graduate.

1072
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:31,628
Well... I guess I have no other choice...

1073
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:37,058
I'll let you in on a big secret.

1074
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:39,871
<i>Secret?</i>

1075
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,944
<i>Iruka.</i>

1076
01:29:45,768 --> 01:29:47,770
<i>What is it, Lord Hokage?</i>

1077
01:29:48,415 --> 01:29:52,349
<i>I know how you feel. But...</i>

1078
01:29:52,374 --> 01:29:57,045
<i>Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents... like you.</i>

1079
01:30:04,423 --> 01:30:05,216
<i>Let me go!</i>

1080
01:30:05,268 --> 01:30:07,917
<i>My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!</i>

1081
01:30:11,405 --> 01:30:13,157
Wake up, Iruka-sensei!

1082
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:16,869
What's the matter?

1083
01:30:17,226 --> 01:30:19,478
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!

1084
01:30:20,053 --> 01:30:24,194
Naruto... he stole the Scroll of Sealing.

1085
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:26,836
The Scroll of Sealing?!

1086
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,009
Let's see...

1087
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:34,947
The first Jutsu is...
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?

1088
01:30:35,834 --> 01:30:39,233
Seriously?! The first one's a jutsu I'm no good at?

1089
01:30:39,641 --> 01:30:42,011
Lord Hokage!
We can't just forgive him this time!

1090
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:43,274
This is not just a prank!

1091
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:47,391
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!

1092
01:30:47,764 --> 01:30:49,317
Depending on its use...

1093
01:30:50,012 --> 01:30:53,307
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!

1094
01:30:55,124 --> 01:30:57,844
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!

1095
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,244
Yes, sir!

1096
01:31:09,443 --> 01:31:10,778
<i>Where did you go... Naruto?</i>

1097
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,045
<i>I will tell everyone in the village
about this and eliminate Naruto...</i>

1098
01:31:23,757 --> 01:31:27,168
<i>Then the Scroll of Sealing
will be mine!</i>

1099
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:35,076
Found you, Naruto!

1100
01:31:40,769 --> 01:31:42,562
You found me...

1101
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:45,571
And I've only managed to learn one jutsu.

1102
01:31:46,842 --> 01:31:48,886
<i>He's been practicing his jutsu...</i>

1103
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:51,265
<i>until he's this exhausted?</i>

1104
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:54,559
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing jutsu!

1105
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:56,862
And if I do it,
you'll let me graduate, right?!

1106
01:31:56,887 --> 01:32:00,432
If I can do one of the jutsu in here,
I graduate, right?

1107
01:32:01,441 --> 01:32:02,807
Who told you that?

1108
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:08,773
Mizuki-sensei! He told me
about this scroll, and this place...

1109
01:32:12,051 --> 01:32:13,051
<i>Mizuki did?!</i>

1110
01:32:18,365 --> 01:32:20,103
I'm impressed you found this place.

1111
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,662
I see... now I get it.

1112
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:30,227
Naruto, give me that scroll.

1113
01:32:30,797 --> 01:32:33,884
Wait, wait...
What's going on here?

1114
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,997
Naruto! Do not give him that scroll!

1115
01:32:39,553 --> 01:32:43,808
It's a dangerous object
that contains Forbidden Jutsu.

1116
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,712
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!

1117
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:49,312
Wha?

1118
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:54,742
Naruto, Iruka's just scared of
you getting that power!

1119
01:32:55,004 --> 01:32:56,004
Huh?

1120
01:32:57,936 --> 01:33:01,315
What are you saying, Mizuki?!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!

1121
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,923
I will tell you the truth.

1122
01:33:05,143 --> 01:33:06,299
Idiot! Don't do that!

1123
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:10,876
After the incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.

1124
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:13,876
A rule?

1125
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:19,885
It's a rule everyone in the village knows, Naruto...
everyone but you.

1126
01:33:20,631 --> 01:33:24,134
Except me?!
What is it?

1127
01:33:24,755 --> 01:33:26,006
Stop it, Mizuki!

1128
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:30,647
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that the Nine-Tails is inside you!

1129
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:32,522
Huh?

1130
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:36,728
That's right...
The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox

1131
01:33:36,753 --> 01:33:39,756
that killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!

1132
01:33:40,145 --> 01:33:41,317
Stop it!

1133
01:33:42,686 --> 01:33:45,856
Everyone has been
deceiving you this whole time.

1134
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:48,933
Didn't you find it strange?

1135
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:51,752
Why everyone hated you so much?

1136
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:56,672
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

1137
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:58,632
<i>Naruto...</i>

1138
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:04,330
No one will ever accept you!
That's why Iruka hates your guts!

1139
01:34:04,763 --> 01:34:06,485
Die, Naruto!

1140
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:10,418
Naruto!
Get down!

1141
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:22,325
Wh-Why...?

1142
01:34:24,307 --> 01:34:26,014
Because you and I are the same.

1143
01:34:27,032 --> 01:34:28,784
After my parents died,

1144
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:33,624
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.

1145
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:37,054
I wasn't a good student in school.

1146
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:42,751
I became the class clown...
because I wanted people to notice me.

1147
01:34:43,616 --> 01:34:49,414
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.

1148
01:34:52,941 --> 01:34:53,984
It hurt so much.

1149
01:34:56,164 --> 01:34:58,430
Isn't that right, Naruto?

1150
01:34:59,252 --> 01:35:04,431
You must have been so lonely...
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1151
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:07,368
I'm sorry, Naruto...

1152
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:13,540
If I had been a better teacher,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.

1153
01:35:19,713 --> 01:35:20,713
Naruto!

1154
01:35:22,448 --> 01:35:24,241
Narutoooooo!

1155
01:35:26,908 --> 01:35:29,828
He's not the type of kid
to change his mind.

1156
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:34,111
He's going to use the scroll
to take revenge on the village!

1157
01:35:35,477 --> 01:35:39,315
Did you see the look in his eyes?
Those were the eyes of a monster.

1158
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:47,616
No...
Naruto... isn't... like that at all!

1159
01:35:50,552 --> 01:35:54,223
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.

1160
01:35:55,052 --> 01:35:56,553
I'll take care of you later!

1161
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:00,670
Naruto!

1162
01:36:00,864 --> 01:36:02,657
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!

1163
01:36:03,034 --> 01:36:06,955
Give me that scroll, quick!
That's what Mizuki is after!

1164
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:22,609
It can't be...

1165
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,826
Why is it, Naruto?

1166
01:36:32,764 --> 01:36:33,765
How...

1167
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:37,608
did you know I wasn't Iruka?

1168
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:43,410
Because I'm Iruka.

1169
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:46,328
I see.

1170
01:36:48,901 --> 01:36:52,154
Why bother try to protect
the thing that killed your family?

1171
01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:55,809
I'm won't let a fool
like you have the scroll!

1172
01:36:56,663 --> 01:37:00,625
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.

1173
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,816
Same?

1174
01:37:03,392 --> 01:37:07,063
Anyone with that scroll
would have limitless power.

1175
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,099
There's no way that that monster...

1176
01:37:09,228 --> 01:37:12,773
that Demon Fox, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!

1177
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:14,787
You're right...

1178
01:37:18,351 --> 01:37:20,198
<i>I guess it was true all along!</i>

1179
01:37:21,005 --> 01:37:27,110
<i>Iruka-sensei never really
cared about me at all!</i>

1180
01:37:27,483 --> 01:37:29,291
... if he were the Demon Fox,
that is.

1181
01:37:31,224 --> 01:37:32,934
But Naruto is different!

1182
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:38,186
He might not be the best student...

1183
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:40,871
He's single-minded and clumsy...

1184
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:44,894
But he tries harder than anyone!

1185
01:37:44,919 --> 01:37:51,009
He's been ignored by everyone, 
so he knows what it's like to feel pain.

1186
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:53,614
He is not the Demon Fox.

1187
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:56,607
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

1188
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:04,274
You're so gullible, Iruka.

1189
01:38:04,976 --> 01:38:07,937
I was gonna take you down later,
but I've changed my mind.

1190
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:09,633
Die!

1191
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,600
<i>Naruto?!</i>

1192
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:24,064
You surprised me there, freak.

1193
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:29,904
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka-sensei,
I'll kill you!

1194
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:34,867
Shut up! I can kill a brat
like you with a single blow!

1195
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:39,927
Try it!
And I'll return it a thousand times over!

1196
01:38:40,203 --> 01:38:44,217
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

1197
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:46,712
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1198
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:57,681
<i>Naruto! You've...</i>

1199
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:04,413
<i>Those aren't illusions, they're solid clones!
That's a high-level ninjutsu!</i>

1200
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:07,482
What's this...?

1201
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:10,241
What's the matter?
C'mon!

1202
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:13,989
Weren't you gonna kill me
in one blow? Well, here I am!

1203
01:39:14,347 --> 01:39:16,766
In that case...
I'm coming for you!

1204
01:39:33,045 --> 01:39:37,550
I kinda got carried away.
Iruka-sensei, are you okay?

1205
01:39:38,588 --> 01:39:39,588
Yeah.

1206
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:46,128
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

1207
01:39:49,395 --> 01:39:51,480
Has anyone found Naruto yet?

1208
01:39:51,831 --> 01:39:52,831
No.

1209
01:39:52,986 --> 01:39:55,614
Damn, this is bad...

1210
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:58,857
There's no need to worry anymore.

1211
01:40:00,123 --> 01:40:01,207
Lord Hokage!

1212
01:40:02,292 --> 01:40:05,030
He'll be back soon.

1213
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:08,335
Sensei, how much longer?

1214
01:40:08,835 --> 01:40:11,004
Alright, open your eyes now.

1215
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,352
Congratulations on graduating.

1216
01:40:30,101 --> 01:40:34,438
To celebrate, we'll have ramen tonight!

1217
01:40:41,628 --> 01:40:43,046
Iruka-sensei!

1218
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:44,538
That hurts!

1219
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:46,707
<i>Naruto...</i>

1220
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,800
<i>I was going to lecture you...</i>

1221
01:40:49,825 --> 01:40:53,370
<i>that the road gets more difficult
now that you're a ninja.</i>

1222
01:40:53,823 --> 01:40:58,077
<i>But I guess it can wait
until we're at Ichiraku Ramen...</i>

1223
01:41:06,555 --> 01:41:08,139
Even if it was a coincidence,

1224
01:41:08,245 --> 01:41:11,957
it seems Naruto's recklessness
saved the village.

1225
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:13,349
You may leave.

1226
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,027
Yes, sir.

1227
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:20,490
What's wrong?

1228
01:41:20,701 --> 01:41:22,591
Lord Hokage... Umm...

1229
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:27,811
Thank you for placing me
in charge of Naruto.

1230
01:41:29,703 --> 01:41:35,000
Because of that, I remembered
why I wanted to become a teacher.

1231
01:41:36,327 --> 01:41:37,474
Lord Hokage...

1232
01:41:37,499 --> 01:41:40,585
It was because of something
you told me long ago.

1233
01:41:48,245 --> 01:41:50,247
It's already been a year, huh?

1234
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:55,704
Smiling while hiding
your sadness isn't easy, is it?

1235
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:05,094
I heard from your teacher that
you're the center of laughter.

1236
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,751
I'm not sad!

1237
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:15,959
It's an honor for a ninja
to die on a mission!

1238
01:42:18,965 --> 01:42:21,384
Mom and dad sacrificed their lives
to protect the village

1239
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:23,720
from the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.

1240
01:42:23,745 --> 01:42:24,988
They're heroes!

1241
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:30,194
I'm the son of heroes,
so I'm not sad!

1242
01:42:30,219 --> 01:42:31,575
These are tears of joy!

1243
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,810
That's enough.

1244
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:39,403
I know that you crawl into
a ball when you're by yourself.

1245
01:42:41,787 --> 01:42:44,332
But you are not alone.

1246
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:50,008
The ninja of the Hidden Leaf
carry the Will of Fire in them.

1247
01:42:52,564 --> 01:42:53,732
Will of Fire?

1248
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:58,214
It's the strong will to
protect this village.

1249
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,387
As long as you have
the Will of Fire in you,

1250
01:43:01,412 --> 01:43:04,916
everyone in the village
is your family.

1251
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:10,142
Iruka... Do you have that?

1252
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,274
Yes!

1253
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:27,492
I want to pass on your Will of Fire
to the next generation of children, and to Naruto.
