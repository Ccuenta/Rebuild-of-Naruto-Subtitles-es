1
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,649
This rock is reserved for me!

2
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,808
The great Naruto, the Fifth Hokage!

3
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,674
Naruto again?

4
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,211
Enough with the stupid pranks!

5
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,418
Looks like he drew
his own face this time!

6
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,368
That little...

7
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:31,675
Look at that!

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,439
I can't believe they let him
graduate from the Academy!

9
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,535
Our Hidden Leaf's ninja
have gone downhill...

10
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,027
Is he all right? I mean...
Considering what he is...

11
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,940
We're forbidden to talk about that.

12
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,382
Oops... Sorry.

13
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:46,831
Oh shut up already!

14
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,790
What are you doing?!
What kind of an idiot are you?!

15
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,654
Huh? Iruka-sensei!

16
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,388
Naruto!

17
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,065
You just graduated!
Why would you do that?

18
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:18,843
I just thought it'd be a cool way to
celebrate my graduation, y'know?

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,168
You clean all that up right now!

20
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:26,774
Yes!

21
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:34,754
Unbelievable... you're about
to become a Genin, you know.

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,819
I'm worried about your future.

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,248
This is the last day you'll
have to worry about me, Iruka-sensei!

24
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:48,649
From now on, I'm gonna work
my butt off to become Hokage!

25
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,618
And I'll surpass all
the Hokage before me!

26
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,360
<i>Naruto...</i>

27
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:10,645
What are you talking about?
Becoming Hokage's not as easy as you think!

28
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,550
Just watch me, Iruka-sensei!

29
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,286
Where does all that confidence come from?

30
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,588
I'm gonna work my butt off!
You'll see!

31
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,704
Good grief...

32
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,118
Hey, you!

33
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,516
Are you sure you want
to look like that?

34
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,913
Yes, of course!
C'mon! Hurry!

35
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,166
Don't regret it later.

36
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,811
Say cheese!

37
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,142
I couldn't decide on how to look.

38
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,699
It took me three hours to decide.

39
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,191
But as you can see,
it's more like a work of art.

40
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,753
Doesn't it look great?

41
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,152
Do it over.

42
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:47,275
What?!

43
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:50,892
Do it over.

44
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:53,393
Stop saying that!

45
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,791
<i>Transform!</i>

46
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,715
Oh please, Lord Hokage...

47
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:27,048
The Sexy Jutsu...
What a foolish technique.

48
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:32,356
By the way, Naruto,
where's your headband?

49
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:36,311
I'm not wearing it 'til the orientation.
Don't wanna get it scratched.

50
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,350
Well, that's just fine.

51
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:43,214
But the Ninja Registration Form
is a very important document

52
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:46,161
held in high regard by our village.

53
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,141
Why do you want to look like this?

54
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:50,979
Because!

55
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,012
Anyway, how am I supposed to know
all that stuff?!

56
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,812
Old Man! Get ready to fight!

57
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:01,468
I'm gonna be the Fifth Hokage!

58
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:07,178
Ouch!

59
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,326
<i>If it's not one thing, it's another...</i>

60
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,672
Drat! Is this a trap?

61
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,036
Are you all right,
Honorable Grandson?

62
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,558
And may I just inform you that
there aren't any traps here...

63
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,010
<i>Huh? What's with this runt?</i>

64
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,114
What?!

65
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,409
<i>I know this kid...
He's the boy with Nine-Tails!</i>

66
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,723
You must have done this to me!

67
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,790
You tripped all by yourself, stupid!

68
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:36,376
Hey! Let go of him!

69
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:39,610
He is the grandson of the Third Hokage!

70
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:46,010
<i>He stopped as soon as
he learned who I am...</i>

71
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,968
<i>He's just like that four-eyed
tutor of mine.</i>

72
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:51,750
<i>He's just like everyone else!</i>

73
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,852
What's the matter?

74
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,546
Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?

75
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,373
Can't do it 'cause
I'm the Hokage's grandson, huh?

76
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:01,943
As if I care!
Idiot!

77
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,697
What?!

78
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,074
<i>Good grief...</i>

79
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,592
Stop following me!

80
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:26,717
What is it now?!

81
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,931
You've seen through my disguise...

82
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,109
Your reputation is well-earned.

83
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,678
I will allow you to make me
your apprentice.

84
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,902
But you must first teach me that
"Sexy Jutsu" technique

85
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,040
you used to defeat my grandpa, the Hokage!

86
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,381
You gotta be kidding.

87
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:51,197
Please, Boss! Say you'll do it!

88
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:52,445
Huh?

89
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Boss?

90
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:56,146
Boss! Boss! Boss!

91
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,542
I guess I have no choice.

92
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,880
He's gone!

93
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,300
It seems he's gone after Naruto.

94
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,009
Oh no!

95
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,302
This is terrible!

96
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,304
Honorable Grandson!

97
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:19,399
That Naruto... What is he teaching
the Honorable Grandson...?

98
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,984
Where the hell could they be...?

99
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:30,490
I am an elite tutor who trains
future Hokage.

100
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,037
All those who interfere
will be eliminated.

101
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:51,806
You know I've been wondering...

102
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,168
You seem obsessed with beating
your grandpa, the Hokage.

103
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,679
My name is Konohamaru.

104
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:03,723
It was Grandpa who gave me
that name.

105
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,337
He named me after the village.

106
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:12,106
It should be easy for everyone
here to remember.

107
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,326
But nobody ever calls me
by that name.

108
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:21,712
When they see me, all they see
is the grandson of Lord Hokage.

109
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,419
No one sees me for who I really am.

110
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,413
I can't stand it anymore.

111
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:31,107
That's why...

112
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:35,112
That's why I want the title
of Hokage now!

113
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:41,292
You idiot... No one's going
to acknowledge you as Hokage that way?

114
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:42,268
Huh?

115
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:46,192
You won't win the title
that easily, you know.

116
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:47,217
What?!

117
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,469
It's not that simple.

118
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:55,417
If you're really serious about gaining
the title of Hokage...

119
00:09:56,478 --> 00:09:57,478
What?

120
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,132
You'll have to beat me first!

121
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,680
I have found you!

122
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,051
Huh?

123
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:19,766
<i>That Demon Fox kid!</i>

124
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,647
<i>That cold look!
It's always like that!</i>

125
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,196
Honorable Grandson,
we must depart now.

126
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,508
No way!

127
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:34,202
I want to beat Grandpa
so I can become Hokage!

128
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,010
Don't get in my way!

129
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:40,328
A Hokage must first know about virtue,
honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,

130
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:41,938
judgment, obedience
and all that.

131
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,543
He must be skilled at more than
a thousand techniques...

132
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:45,568
And then...

133
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,361
<i>Transform!</i>

134
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,470
Take this! Sexy Jutsu!

135
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,243
What?
It didn't work!

136
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,849
What kind of
disgraceful technique is that?!

137
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,976
I am a gentleman!

138
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:07,928
Such vulgar attacks
will never work on me!

139
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:13,779
Honorable Grandson!
That punk will only turn you into an idiot!

140
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:17,103
Stick with me and...

141
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:20,493
I will provide you with a shortcut
to becoming the Fifth Hokage.

142
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,245
C'mon, let's go!

143
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,328
No way!

144
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:24,843
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

145
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,657
Wow!
Fantastic!

146
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,015
Ha!
That's nothing.

147
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:45,685
I am a distinguished teacher.

148
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:48,354
I'm not as easily fooled as Mizuki.

149
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:04,844
Boss...

150
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,501
<i>Transform!</i>

151
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,463
<i>Transform!</i>

152
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:20,887
Oh, Master Ebisu...

153
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:33,357
I call this one... the "Harem Jutsu"!

154
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:39,405
He combined the Clones with
his own Sexy Jutsu.

155
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,580
<i>That's another devious attack.</i>

156
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:46,632
<i>Even I would probably fall for it...</i>

157
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:55,949
I can't even beat that
four-eyed tutor of mine!

158
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:59,605
All I want is a name that
will be recognized by everybody!

159
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,056
But I keep failing.

160
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,744
You think it's that easy?

161
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:05,096
Huh?

162
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:08,593
It's given only to the greatest ninja
in the village.

163
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,844
You have to get everyone
in the village to acknowledge you.

164
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,943
I've been through a lot already.

165
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,066
It's been one struggle after another.

166
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:25,171
But after all that,
I found someone who accepts me.

167
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,746
I had to go through all that...
Just for one person.

168
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,273
You had better push yourself.

169
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:33,834
For what?

170
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:40,381
The path of becoming
Hokage is a brutal one.

171
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:52,350
There's no such thing as a shortcut.

172
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,439
Who do you think you are,
lecturing me like that?

173
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:03,111
I won't be your apprentice anymore.

174
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,120
From now on, you're my rival.

175
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,909
To bad for you, I'll graduate
from the Ninja Academy tomorrow!

176
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:26,248
But, someday we'll fight as equals
for the title of Hokage.

177
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:31,987
You'd better be ready, Konohamaru.

178
00:14:56,142 --> 00:15:01,565
<i>You still have a long way to go
to become a real ninja.</i>

179
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:23,007
They're supposed to
be five years apart in age.

180
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,465
Lady Hanabi is quite amazing...

181
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:36,873
How was training today?

182
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,210
The same as usual...

183
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,370
You seem depressed.

184
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,423
You used to have
so much fun in the past...

185
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,096
Yeah...

186
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,659
I observed for a while...

187
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,050
It will be difficult to have
Hinata succeed the Head Family.

188
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:01,314
A decision has to be made.

189
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,142
I understand.

190
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:09,129
However, I'd like to
make one request.

191
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,478
You two will participate
in a mock battle today.

192
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,347
Huh?

193
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,444
I want to see all the skill and
power you've gained until now.

194
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,092
Do not go easy on each other.

195
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,773
Fight with the intent
to defeat each other!

196
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,567
Hinata...

197
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:31,595
You are the successor of the Hyuga Clan.

198
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:34,022
Show me that
you are worthy of that.

199
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:36,058
Yes.

200
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:42,105
<i>But I'm just supposed to fight...</i>

201
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,330
Begin!

202
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,659
<i>Big Sister Hinata!</i>

203
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,737
They're both amazing!

204
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,770
<i>There's no end to this!</i>

205
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:15,752
<i>Right there!</i>

206
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:19,168
<i>Oh no!</i>

207
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,880
Stop!

208
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:01,357
Father...

209
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:04,683
To fall to Hanabi who is
five years younger than you...

210
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,380
Enough. You may go.

211
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:25,071
Hinata will probably serve
the village as a Genin.

212
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:27,581
I see.

213
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,141
As sad as it seems,

214
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:34,665
we cannot allow a failure
like that to be our successor.

215
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,004
This is her destiny.

216
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,979
That you were born stronger
than your sister is also destiny.

217
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,083
Hanabi,

218
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:51,370
you must hone your skills
to the utmost for the sake of the Hyuga.

219
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:55,465
Yes.

220
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,356
Stand, Hanabi.

221
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,274
Hinata will be under
my command from now on.

222
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:29,213
But, are you sure about this?

223
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,257
Hinata is the successor
of the Hyuga clan.

224
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:38,432
Genin missions carry
a high risk of death.

225
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,969
Do what you will with her.

226
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,773
She couldn't beat Hanabi
who is five years younger...

227
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,023
The Hyuga have no need
for such a person.

228
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,669
<i>Father has turned his back
on my sister...</i>

229
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:02,379
Is that all you wanted to discuss?
If so, you may go.

230
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:03,897
We are busy here.

231
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:05,418
Understood.

232
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,701
Continue, Hanabi.

233
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,258
Yes.

234
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:22,174
<i>If Big Sister can't do it, then
I have to.</i>

235
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,875
<i>I will protect the Hyuga.</i>

236
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,072
<i>This is my destiny!</i>

237
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:44,933
I wonder if he's going to be okay...

238
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,474
He's a bit of a coward.

239
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,462
He finally became a Genin,
but he doesn't like confrontation.

240
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,764
He'll soon go out on missions

241
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:02,178
and may have to face foes
in life-or-death battles.

242
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,097
As it is...

243
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:08,572
Choji could be killed because
he was too scared to make a move.

244
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,822
I doubt he'll ever become a Chunin.

245
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:17,575
Your son is not a coward.
He's just kind.

246
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:20,668
In the shinobi world,
it's the same thing.

247
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:24,066
Then let him be kind.

248
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,569
"Be kind"?

249
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:30,595
Yes. His kindness
is a unique weapon

250
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,667
which he, and he alone, possesses.

251
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:35,973
Weapon...

252
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:38,158
He's just a boy.

253
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,374
It can't be helped if it's
viewed as cowardice.

254
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:44,170
But, someday, that kindness
will become his greatest strength.

255
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:49,870
The time will come when the
Hidden Leaf will need his kindness.

256
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:54,765
However, he will require
strength that rivals his kindness.

257
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,853
He needs the strength
to recognize other's pain,

258
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,688
to feel and accept their pain...

259
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:04,699
Or reject it... but still
envelop them in kindness.

260
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,391
That boy has those qualities.

261
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:09,472
Asuma...

262
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:14,025
Choji will experience many things.

263
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:18,777
This is the shinobi world,
the hardships will be many.

264
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:23,367
But with each experience,
he will grow stronger and kinder.

265
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,061
Today's... a special day, so...

266
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:03,664
Time to eat!

267
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,532
Sakura!
Shouldn't you be heading out soon?

268
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:40,532
I was thinking of leaving now!

269
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,704
<i>Cha! How long are they going
to keep treating me like a child?!</i>

270
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,223
<i>That's right... I'm not a student
at the academy anymore...</i>

271
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:57,362
<i>I'm a Kunoichi of the Hidden Leaf,
Sakura Haruno!</i>

272
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,022
I'm off!

273
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,268
Morning, Sakura.

274
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:10,437
Morning... Ino.

275
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,005
Who would've thought you'd
be able to graduate.

276
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,325
That's ancient history.

277
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,153
As of today,
we're both real ninja...

278
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:28,830
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!

279
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:53,249
What the... Why are you here?

280
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,191
Today's meeting is for graduates only.

281
00:24:57,025 --> 00:25:00,904
Hey, don't you see the headband?

282
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,326
As of today, I'm a ninja too!

283
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:10,413
What can I say? It really suits me!

284
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,210
<i>So Naruto... was able to graduate.</i>

285
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:26,054
Goal!

286
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,642
I won again, Sakura!

287
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:32,082
What are you saying?

288
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:35,921
The tip of my foot was
a centimeter faster!

289
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,150
You must be blind.

290
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,819
<i>It's Sakura.</i>

291
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,490
Oh...

292
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,113
<i>Sakura's looking at me...</i>

293
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:53,455
Hey, Sakura!

294
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,500
M-Morning, Sakura!

295
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,625
Get outta the way!

296
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,754
M-Morning, Sasuke...

297
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:05,468
Mind if I sit next to you?

298
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,222
Hey! I'm going to sit
next to Sasuke!

299
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:10,757
First come, first served!

300
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,961
I got in the classroom sooner!

301
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:14,853
I did!

302
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,313
If that's the case, then I did!

303
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:17,354
I was first!

304
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,566
I'm sitting next to Sasuke!

305
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:23,152
<i>How annoying...</i>

306
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:34,623
Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!

307
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:37,500
<i>Sakura...</i>

308
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:41,129
<i>Everyone's all, "Sasuke! Sasuke!".</i>

309
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,298
<i>What's so great about this guy?!</i>

310
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,554
Just beat him up, Sasuke!

311
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:50,721
Yeah! Yeah!

312
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:53,161
What? Really?

313
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,543
Oh! Sorry!

314
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:55,845
Wha?

315
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:57,199
Whoa!

316
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:11,368
<i>Cha! I was planning on
seizing Sasuke's first kiss!</i>

317
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,831
You jerk...
Naruto! I'll kill you!

318
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:19,003
- My mouth is rotting...
- Huh? Was that my fault?

319
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:21,836
What? I... feel rage...

320
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:24,964
Naruto...

321
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:27,163
You...

322
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,537
An accident...
It was an accident!

323
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
You're so annoying!

324
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:34,164
Yikes!

325
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,562
As of today,
you all have become real ninja.

326
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,082
However, you're still Genin.

327
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:45,193
The tough part's still to come!

328
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,030
From here on,
you'll be in a squad of three

329
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,586
and carry out missions
under your Jonin leader.

330
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:54,677
The teams have been determined

331
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:57,455
so that the strength of
the teams will be balanced.

332
00:27:58,248 --> 00:27:59,749
Now for the assignments!

333
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,460
First is Team 7...

334
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:04,456
Naruto Uzumaki!

335
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:06,798
Sakura Haruno.

336
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:09,801
Hooray!

337
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,845
<i>I'm with... Naruto?</i>

338
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:14,097
And... Sasuke Uchiha!

339
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:15,724
Hooray!

340
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,809
<i>I'm with... Sasuke?</i>

341
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:24,316
<i>So I'll be in a different group
from Naruto, huh...</i>

342
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:27,861
Next is Team Eight. Hinata Hyuga!

343
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:29,973
Y-Yes...

344
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:31,489
Kiba Inuzuka!

345
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,034
Shino Aburame!

346
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,332
Why is this happening?

347
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:41,624
Team Nine.

348
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,182
<i>Cha! Love will be victorious!</i>

349
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Man...

350
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:50,670
Why do women think that
kind of guy's so great?

351
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:54,063
Don't you understand, Shikamaru?

352
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:56,797
Well, I'm not a woman...

353
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,284
That's why you aren't
popular with girls.

354
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,735
I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.

355
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:10,833
Team Ten. Ino Yamanaka.
Shikamaru Nara.

356
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,688
It appears we've been
grouped together.

357
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:18,495
And Choji Akimichi.

358
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,134
<i>And fatty on top of that...</i>

359
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,105
That's all for the group division.

360
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,381
Iruka-sensei!

361
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,525
Why does an exceptional student
like me have to be

362
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,649
in the same group as this guy?!

363
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:38,425
Sasuke has the best grades
of the graduates.

364
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,184
Naruto, you're at the bottom!

365
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,302
This is how it is when trying
to balance the strength within groups.

366
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,402
Just don't get in my way, loser!

367
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,296
Hey, what did you say?!

368
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:54,616
You wanna fight, loser?

369
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,256
Knock it off, Naruto!!

370
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:01,849
In the afternoon,
I'll introduce you to your Jonin leaders.

371
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,303
You're dismissed until then!

372
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,415
<i>Damn. This is no fun!</i>

373
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:14,063
<i>I'm finally in the same group
as Sakura and it has to be like this...</i>

374
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:17,078
I wonder if something good will happen...

375
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:25,440
That's it!

376
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,698
Is that you, Naruto? You jerk!

377
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:35,578
Just be quiet!

378
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,476
<i>No need for me to feel rushed...</i>

379
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,933
<i>From here on out I'll be in
the same group as Sasuke...</i>

380
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:51,985
<i>But...</i>

381
00:30:56,711 --> 00:31:00,377
<i>Even if I were to use my feminine charms,
my proportions are below average...</i>

382
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:03,412
<i>The only thing I've got going on
is this big forehead...</i>

383
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:05,485
<i>What should I do?</i>

384
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,155
<i>Huh? No way!</i>

385
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,871
<i>Sasuke is looking this way!</i>

386
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,989
<i>And with such a passionate look!</i>

387
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,027
<i>You... have a charmingly wide forehead.</i>

388
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,130
<i>It makes me want to kiss it.</i>

389
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:30,184
<i>If you mean it... then go ahead</i>

390
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,319
<i>Yeah, right...</i>

391
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,668
<i>I'm not just some kid
who believes in fairy tales...</i>

392
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,674
<i>There's no way.</i>

393
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,140
You...

394
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:42,317
have a charmingly wide forehead.

395
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,413
What?

396
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,273
It makes me want to kiss it.

397
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:57,881
<i>Cha! This fairy tale is for real!</i>

398
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:02,557
Well, that's something Naruto would say.

399
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:06,051
I've got something to ask you.

400
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,263
What do you think... of Naruto?

401
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:20,237
He's always interfering and
it's like he enjoys it when I make mistakes.

402
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:24,998
Naruto doesn't understand
one thing about me...

403
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:28,312
He just annoys me!

404
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:30,625
All I want...

405
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,856
is for you to accept me, Sasuke.

406
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:37,075
For me to accept you?

407
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:42,631
I'll do anything for the sake of that.

408
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:54,938
<i>I was careless!</i>

409
00:32:57,896 --> 00:33:00,188
I'm desperate, so...

410
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:03,953
<i>I finally know why I...</i>

411
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:08,572
<i>like Sakura so much.</i>

412
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:15,068
<i>Diarrhea at a time like this?</i>

413
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,163
What's wrong?

414
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:20,896
I-I'll be right back!

415
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,357
Sasuke's so shy!

416
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,804
I guess he needs to
prepare himself mentally...

417
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:35,807
That was close!

418
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,873
My stomach hurt so much that
my jutsu was about to wear off!

419
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:43,940
Why does my stomach have
to hurt at such a good time?

420
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:47,370
<i>I'm annoying, huh?</i>

421
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,044
<i>She said it again...</i>

422
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:54,022
<i>And I transformed into Sasuke and
got a little closer to Sakura...</i>

423
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:05,524
Oh Sasuke,
you're such a shy bad boy!

424
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,967
Are you prepared?

425
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,534
I'm raring to go!

426
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,505
H-Hey, Sasuke!

427
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:16,830
Where's Naruto?

428
00:34:17,202 --> 00:34:19,822
Oh, there you go changing
the subject again...

429
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,515
Just leave Naruto alone!

430
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:25,847
All he does is pick fights with you!

431
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:29,246
It's because he never had a proper upbringing!

432
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:30,655
You know!

433
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,670
He doesn't have any parents, right?

434
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,283
He always does whatever he wants!

435
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:40,064
My parents would get mad at me
if I did something like that!

436
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,803
There are no parents to nag
you if you're all alone!

437
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:48,026
That's why he's so selfish
all the time!

438
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:50,193
Loneliness.

439
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:51,272
Huh?

440
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:55,377
It's far worse than getting
scolded by your parents.

441
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:58,571
W-What's gotten into you?

442
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:02,165
You're... annoying.

443
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:16,574
So this is Naruto's room...

444
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:21,252
Sasuke Uchiha is also part
of the team assigned to you.

445
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:22,852
I wish you luck!

446
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,652
The expiration date...

447
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,783
This milk went bad a while ago...

448
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:36,834
He'll get sick if he drinks this.

449
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,495
Looks like this one's going
to be a handful.

450
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:50,280
Naruto!

451
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:51,473
Stay still.

452
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:56,864
Why is our teacher the only one who's late?

453
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,826
The other squads have already
gone off with their new teachers.

454
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,287
Even Iruka-sensei left.

455
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:04,738
Don't look at me.

456
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,501
Hey! What are you doing, Naruto?!

457
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,880
Hey!

458
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,593
This is what he gets for being late!

459
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,767
Man! You're asking for it!

460
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,770
<i>I love this kind of stuff!</i>

461
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,900
A Jonin wouldn't fall for
a childish trap like that.

462
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:36,622
That's right. You're such an idiot!

463
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,577
I got him! I got him!

464
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,540
I-I'm sorry, Sensei.

465
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,934
I tried to stop him,
but Naruto wouldn't listen...

466
00:36:51,404 --> 00:36:52,404
<i>Okay!</i>

467
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,841
You've got to be kidding.
Is he really a Jonin?

468
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:02,263
How should I put this?

469
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,290
My first impression of you guys?

470
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,308
Well, I don't like you.

471
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,603
Let's see.

472
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:13,241
First off, I'd like
you guys to introduce yourselves.

473
00:37:13,695 --> 00:37:15,030
Introduce ourselves...?

474
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,588
What should we say?

475
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:25,813
Your likes, dislikes, dream for the future,
hobbies... that sort of thing.

476
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:32,142
Hey! Before that,
you should tell us about yourself.

477
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:36,889
Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.

478
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:41,682
I have no desire to tell you
my likes and dislikes.

479
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:46,640
My dream for the future...
I've never really thought about it.

480
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:51,147
As for my hobbies, I have many.

481
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,941
So all we learned was his name?

482
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:55,886
Yeah.

483
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:57,807
Now it's your turn.

484
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,654
Let's start with you.

485
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:03,274
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

486
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,068
I like instant ramen,

487
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,596
but what I like even more
is the ramen from Ichiraku

488
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,122
that Iruka-sensei treats me to.

489
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,520
What I dislike is the three minutes

490
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,464
you have to wait for ramen to be cooked.

491
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,275
My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!

492
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:18,803
And my dream for the future...

493
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,674
is to surpass all the Hokage!

494
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,093
And then the entire village

495
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:26,205
will have to acknowledge my existence!

496
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,236
<i>I see...</i>

497
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,443
<i>This kid's grown up in
an interesting way.</i>

498
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:34,366
Okay, next.

499
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:36,157
I'm Sakura Haruno.

500
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:40,766
What I like...
I mean, who I like is...

501
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,824
And, my hobby is, I mean...

502
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,033
My dream for the future is...

503
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:54,333
And?
What about your dislikes?

504
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,084
Naruto!

505
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,312
And lastly.

506
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,132
My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.

507
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:07,076
There are lots of things I dislike,
and not many things I like.

508
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:09,401
Oh...

509
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:10,995
And...

510
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,644
I don't believe much in dreams,

511
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:14,982
but I have an ambition:

512
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:19,575
To restore my clan...

513
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:22,297
and to kill a certain man!

514
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,133
<i>I knew it...</i>

515
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,183
Good!

516
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,336
You three are all unique and interesting!

517
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,704
We'll have a mission tomorrow!

518
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,498
Yes! What kind of mission?!

519
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:37,387
A survival exercise.

520
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:39,730
Survival exercise?

521
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,050
We did tons of survival training
at the Academy!

522
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,138
This is no simple exercise.

523
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,346
Then... then what kind of exercise is it?

524
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,979
Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?

525
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,276
Well, if I told you, you'd probably
just get discouraged.

526
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,901
What?

527
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,871
Of the 27 graduates,

528
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:10,615
only nine will be accepted
as Genin.

529
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,913
The remaining 18 will
be sent back to the Academy.

530
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:19,043
In other words, this exercise
is an extremely difficult test

531
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,754
with a failure rate of over 66%!

532
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:25,090
See, see?

533
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,532
You're already chickening out!

534
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:28,455
That's crazy!

535
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:29,997
All that hard work... for nothing?!

536
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:33,695
Then, what was the point
of the graduation exam?!

537
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:35,429
Oh, that.

538
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,612
That was just to select candidates
who have the potential of becoming Genin.

539
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,981
Whaaaat?!

540
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,816
Well, in any event...

541
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:46,737
I'll be determining whether
you pass or fail.

542
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,989
Bring your complete set
of ninja tools!

543
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,741
We meet at five in the morning.

544
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:57,272
<i>N-No way am I going to be
dropped now!</i>

545
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,260
<i>I have to make them truly
acknowledge my strength.</i>

546
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:05,669
<i>I'll be separated from Sasuke
if I fail this test.</i>

547
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:07,829
<i>This is a test of love!</i>

548
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,289
Okay! You're dismissed.

549
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,966
Oh... and you'd best skip breakfast.

550
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,592
You'll throw up.

551
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,991
Morning.

552
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,724
Hey everyone. Good morning!

553
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,544
You're late!

554
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:04,857
Well, a black cat crossed
my path, you see.

555
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,695
Ahem! Oh well...

556
00:42:12,105 --> 00:42:14,357
Okay, the alarm is set for noon.

557
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:23,000
Your assignment is to take
these bells away from me before then.

558
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,295
Anyone without a bell,
doesn't get lunch.

559
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,047
You'll be tied to that stump...

560
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:31,491
and I'll eat your lunch
right in front of you.

561
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,342
<i>So that was the point...</i>

562
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,398
<i>in having us skip breakfast...</i>

563
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,182
But, hold on.

564
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,184
Why are there only two bells?

565
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:43,449
There are only two,
to ensure at the very least,

566
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,034
one of you will have to
go to the stump.

567
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,961
Also, that person will be disqualified
for failing the mission...

568
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:49,896
and will return to the Academy.

569
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,863
It might just be one of you...

570
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,583
or it could be all three of you.

571
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:57,115
You can use your shuriken.

572
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,661
You won't be able to get these bells unless
you come at me with the intent to kill.

573
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,294
But, that's dangerous, Sensei!

574
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:06,004
Y-Yeah, that's right!

575
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,131
You couldn't even dodge an eraser!

576
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:09,407
In this world,

577
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,299
those with the least ability
tend to complain the most.

578
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,644
So, let's just ignore the loser...

579
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:18,197
We'll begin on my "start" signal.

580
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:20,232
<i>Loser... Loser... Loser...</i>

581
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:35,977
A little impatient, aren't you?
I haven't said "start" yet.

582
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,158
<i>No way...!</i>

583
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:40,557
<i>I didn't see him move at all.</i>

584
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,871
<i>So this is a Jonin.</i>

585
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,623
But, that's fine.

586
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:48,086
At least you came at me with
the intent to kill.

587
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,338
How should I put this?

588
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:52,750
I feel like I'm finally starting...

589
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:53,943
to like you guys.

590
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:57,791
Start!

591
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:05,811
<i>Fundamentally, ninja must mask
their presence and hide.</i>

592
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:17,232
<i>Well, everyone is hidden pretty well...</i>

593
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,671
Alright! Let's face off
fair and square!

594
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:24,832
Oh?

595
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:26,829
That fool...

596
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:30,716
You're a little weird, aren't you?

597
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:33,559
The only thing weird
here is your hairstyle!

598
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:49,229
Shinobi Battle Technique Number One...

599
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,440
Taijutsu.

600
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,485
<i>Taijutsu...?</i>

601
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,536
<i>That's hand-to-hand combat...</i>

602
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,913
<i>So why... is he reaching for a weapon?</i>

603
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,760
What's the matter?

604
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:11,960
Why don't you come at me?

605
00:45:12,402 --> 00:45:15,867
But... hey...
why do you have a book?

606
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:17,453
Why, you ask?

607
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:20,945
Because I want to know
what happens next.

608
00:45:21,397 --> 00:45:22,397
Don't mind it.

609
00:45:22,863 --> 00:45:23,827
With you as my opponent,

610
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:25,612
it makes no difference
if I'm reading or not.

611
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,437
I'm going to rip you apart!

612
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,942
Damn! This time a spin kick!

613
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:38,057
Man!

614
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,700
A ninja should never let an enemy
get behind them, idiot.

615
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,535
<i>That hand sign...</i>

616
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,345
<i>Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!</i>

617
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,281
<i>No way!</i>

618
00:45:48,574 --> 00:45:49,784
<i>With Naruto as his opponent,</i>

619
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:51,618
<i>that ninjutsu is way too powerful
to use on him!</i>

620
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,715
<i>That sign...
He's going to use a Fire Style jutsu.</i>

621
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:58,303
<i>That slacker-sensei... Is he actually
going to do something serious?</i>

622
00:45:58,995 --> 00:46:00,997
Naruto, get out of there quick!

623
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,302
You'll die!

624
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,477
<i>Taijutsu Secret Technique:</i>

625
00:46:05,836 --> 00:46:07,421
<i>A Thousand Years of Death!</i>

626
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,812
That's... not a ninjutsu.

627
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,190
Those two are idiots.

628
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:21,863
Alright...

629
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:27,290
<i>Even so,
isn't that against the rules?</i>

630
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:30,068
<i>What are we supposed to do
about his strength?</i>

631
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:36,550
<i>Damn it!</i>

632
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:38,232
<i>It wasn't supposed to be
like this.</i>

633
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:54,907
What's the matter?

634
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,439
You won't get lunch if you can't
take the bell by noon.

635
00:46:58,567 --> 00:46:59,985
No matter what...

636
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:02,718
I'm... not...

637
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:05,293
turning back now!

638
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:07,451
I'm going to become a ninja!

639
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,420
Here I come!

640
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,091
Now for my specialty,
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

641
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:25,777
<i>Seven... Narutos?</i>

642
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,392
<i>What? They're not just images?</i>

643
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:35,382
<i>Are they all real?
The real thing?</i>

644
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:45,125
The Shadow Clone...
Not the basic Clone.

645
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,534
Judging from your ability,

646
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,995
that jutsu should have
a one-minute limit.

647
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,847
Even if you talk trash,

648
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:57,049
Naruto is still Naruto, after all...

649
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,835
W-What?! Behind me?!

650
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:10,514
"Ninja shouldn't let
the enemy take them from behind."

651
00:48:10,632 --> 00:48:12,384
Right, Kakashi-sensei?

652
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:14,351
I had one of my Shadow Clones

653
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:15,911
sneak out of the water,

654
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:18,858
and snuck up behind you!

655
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:22,208
Here's payback for
what you did to my butt!

656
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:24,257
<i>Naruto, not bad!</i>

657
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,780
<i>So... a diversionary tactic, huh?</i>

658
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:30,854
Now... allow me to punch you!

659
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,502
<i>What?!</i>

660
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,016
Ouch!

661
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:49,402
You!

662
00:48:49,784 --> 00:48:52,161
You're Kakashi-sensei, right?!

663
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,574
You used the Transformation Jutsu
to look like me, didn't you?!

664
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,392
It's you!

665
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,893
You're Kakashi-sensei, I know it!

666
00:48:57,774 --> 00:48:59,484
You smell like Kakashi-sensei!

667
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:00,672
The smell of an old guy!

668
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:03,316
Why you!

669
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,987
Hey!
Why not just undo the jutsu?!

670
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,014
If we do that,
only two of us will remain... so...

671
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:12,056
Why didn't you think of that
sooner, idiot?!

672
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,161
Because I'm you, idiot!
Just undo the jutsu!

673
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:24,998
<i>Naruto...</i>

674
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:26,739
<i>You're embarrassing to watch...</i>

675
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>That was the Substitution Jutsu,
you idiot.</i>

676
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:33,476
<i>Essentially, it's a skill used
to quickly switch one's own body</i>

677
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:35,550
<i>with an object or animal.</i>

678
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:39,019
<i>It makes your enemy think
they're attacking the real you.</i>

679
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,944
<i>He used Naruto's own attack against him.</i>

680
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,270
A bell?!

681
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:51,519
You really must have been in a hurry.

682
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:53,211
You've dropped a bell!

683
00:49:58,091 --> 00:49:59,926
What the heck is this?!

684
00:50:02,674 --> 00:50:04,634
<i>Of course, it's a trap...</i>

685
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:09,872
<i>That Jonin doesn't lower his guard
even when he's fighting Naruto.</i>

686
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,640
You have to think when using jutsu.

687
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,351
They can be used against you.

688
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:26,524
And don't fall for such an obvious
trap, you idiot.

689
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,237
A ninja must see
through deception... got it?

690
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:34,366
I know that!

691
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:38,119
I'm saying it because
you clearly don't get it.

692
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,415
You have too many wasted movements.

693
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,474
<i>Now!</i>

694
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,547
<i>He finally dropped his guard!</i>

695
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:51,596
You're so...

696
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:56,851
No way!

697
00:50:57,252 --> 00:50:59,754
You jerk, Sasuke! You overdid it!

698
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:09,687
<i>Damn! Another substitution?</i>

699
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:12,362
<i>And I just gave away my position
with that attack!</i>

700
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:14,864
<i>So he's over there, huh...</i>

701
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,060
<i>Sasuke... Where are you?!</i>

702
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:22,622
<i>Don't tell me,
Kakashi-sensei already...</i>

703
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:24,285
<i>No!</i>

704
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,935
<i>That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!</i>

705
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:31,344
<i>Safe! He didn't notice me.</i>

706
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:33,883
Sakura, behind you.

707
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:34,637
Huh?!

708
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:43,868
"A ninja must see
through deception", my butt!

709
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:47,647
I'll never fall for one
of his stupid traps again!

710
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,698
I fell for it again!

711
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:19,976
What was that?! Huh?!

712
00:52:20,464 --> 00:52:22,383
Hold on! Where's Sensei?!

713
00:52:22,408 --> 00:52:23,826
Huh?! What's going on?!

714
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:25,732
Huh?! What's what?!

715
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,060
Sakura...

716
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,019
Sasuke?!

717
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,255
Sa... Saku... ra...

718
00:52:32,084 --> 00:52:34,420
P-Please... help... me...

719
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,373
Maybe I went a bit overboard...

720
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:51,442
<i>Was that voice... Sakura's?</i>

721
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,840
Shinobi Battle Technique Number Two: Genjutsu.

722
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:59,219
Sakura fell for it easily.

723
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:00,929
<i>Genjutsu, huh...?</i>

724
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,665
<i>An illusionary technique that attacks
the mind. No wonder she fell for it.</i>

725
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:06,902
<i>However...</i>

726
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,419
I'm different from them.

727
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:16,903
Why don't you say that after
you get a bell... Sasuke?

728
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,454
It's no use just using
straightforward attacks.

729
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:30,874
<i>A trap?!</i>

730
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:47,808
<i>This guy's...?!</i>

731
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,441
<i>What a guy.</i>

732
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,278
<i>There's no time
to read "Make-Out Paradise."</i>

733
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,781
What?!

734
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:08,691
<i>That's right! I saw Sasuke on
the verge of dying and I...</i>

735
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:12,516
Sasuke!
Don't die and leave me here!

736
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:14,657
Where are you?!

737
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:24,053
So that's what it looks like
behind the stumps.

738
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,935
Oh!
There are lunch boxes on the stone!

739
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:35,732
A ninja must see through deception... huh?

740
00:54:39,622 --> 00:54:43,292
Well, I'll acknowledge that
you're different from those two.

741
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:47,376
Horse!

742
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:49,036
Tiger!

743
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:51,992
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

744
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:55,335
<i>What?! That's not a jutsu
that a Genin can do...</i>

745
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:57,784
<i>He shouldn't have
enough chakra for that yet!</i>

746
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:16,272
<i>He's gone!
Is he behind me?! No, above me?!</i>

747
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:27,033
Shinobi Battle Technique Number Three: Ninjutsu.

748
00:55:28,582 --> 00:55:30,501
How's that? You can't move, huh?

749
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:37,228
Although... you certainly have potential.

750
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:39,378
Oh well.

751
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,633
They say the nail that sticks up is
the one that gets hammered down, so...

752
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:50,556
I don't need the bells.
I'll just eat the lunch in secret!

753
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:53,462
Let's eat!!

754
00:55:53,487 --> 00:55:54,487
Hey.

755
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,398
I was just joking...

756
00:55:58,648 --> 00:55:59,648
Too late!

757
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,153
<i>Damn it! There was this much of
a difference in our strength?</i>

758
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:15,858
Sakura...

759
00:56:17,856 --> 00:56:20,108
<i>This time it's a freshly severed head?!</i>

760
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:25,842
What's up with her?

761
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:34,419
Sasuke?

762
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:35,977
You're okay!

763
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:37,712
Hey, cut it out!
Don't cling to me!

764
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:42,442
There's not much time left until noon.
I'm going.

765
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,884
Sasuke, you're still going
after the bells?!

766
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,744
I managed to touch one.
Next time I'll take it.

767
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,451
What?!
I-I see.

768
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,329
As expected,
you're awesome, Sasuke.

769
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,876
<i>There's no way I can take
a bell.</i>

770
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:04,630
<i>At this rate, I'll be
separated from Sasuke...</i>

771
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:09,761
Uh... say.
There's really no time left...

772
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:13,246
So let's just take it easy and
try again next time.

773
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm the only one
who can kill that man.

774
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:32,700
Huh? What?
You mean Sensei?

775
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,496
That day... I was crying.

776
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:38,872
Crying?

777
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,042
My...

778
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:45,779
What? What is it?

779
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:51,552
I am an avenger.
I must become stronger than that man...

780
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:54,806
I can't afford to be held back here.

781
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:00,228
Damn it...
I wasted my time talking.

782
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:13,241
Oh oh, your stomachs are growling...

783
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:16,828
By the way, about this exercise...

784
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:21,499
Well, there's no need for you guys
to go back to the Academy.

785
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,044
Yahooooo!

786
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,933
Then... then!
That means the three of us...

787
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,299
Yes. The three of you...

788
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:33,177
should quit being ninja!

789
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:43,271
What do you want to know?

790
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:48,513
I don't think you invited
me here to just drink tea.

791
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,711
The Jonin in charge of
Naruto's Team 7...

792
00:58:52,506 --> 00:58:56,051
What kind of teacher is he?
Is he strict?

793
00:58:57,312 --> 00:59:00,482
You mean Kakashi?
Does he concern you?

794
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:04,839
I heard a rumor that concerns me.

795
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,833
What's this?

796
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:15,189
It's a pass-fail list of
the junior ninja

797
00:59:15,362 --> 00:59:17,447
Kakashi has been
in charge of up until now.

798
00:59:19,763 --> 00:59:20,763
Let me take a look.

799
00:59:25,031 --> 00:59:26,616
T-This is!

800
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,484
Quit being ninja?!
What do you mean?!

801
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,487
Uh, well, it's true we weren't able to
take the bells...

802
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:36,860
But why does that mean
we should "quit"?!

803
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:41,894
Because the three of you lack
the basic qualifications to be ninja.

804
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:46,972
Oh!

805
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,137
Sasuke!

806
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,762
I'm saying you're just squirts.

807
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:55,718
Don't step on Sasuke!

808
00:59:57,523 --> 01:00:00,831
Man, are you guys brainless or what?

809
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:04,644
Don't you understand the purpose
of this three-man squad test?!

810
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:09,565
How the hell are we supposed to know?!
We didn't pick the teams!

811
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:12,294
It's... teamwork!

812
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,520
You might've been able to...

813
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:19,717
take the bells if the three of you
had come at me together...

814
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,619
Well, it's too bad.

815
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:23,644
<i>Now wait a minute.</i>

816
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:27,333
Why use teamwork if
there were only two bells?

817
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:31,604
Even if the three of us worked together,
one of us would still be held back.

818
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,910
That's not teamwork, that's just
pitting us against each other!

819
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,216
Of course!

820
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,901
This is a test set up to purposely
place you against each other.

821
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:44,859
To see if, under such circumstances,
you could set aside your own interests.

822
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:49,572
The intention was to select those
who could prioritize teamwork...

823
01:00:50,644 --> 01:00:52,604
Yet, instead of that...

824
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:54,189
Sakura!

825
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:58,256
Your only concern was Sasuke,
though you didn't even know where he was.

826
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,616
All while ignoring Naruto,
who was right in front of you...

827
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,740
Naruto!

828
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,204
All you do is run solo...

829
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:11,577
And you, assuming the other two were
just dead weight, acted entirely on your own.

830
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,046
Missions are carried out in teams!

831
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:17,425
Yes, ninja do need
to have individual skills...

832
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:21,707
But teamwork is considered
more important than that.

833
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:27,435
Individuals that disregard teamwork
expose the team to danger... or death...

834
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:29,608
For example...

835
01:01:31,022 --> 01:01:34,525
Sakura!
Kill Naruto, or Sasuke dies.

836
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,945
What?! What?! Whaaat?!

837
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:40,274
That is what will happen.

838
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,097
On top of having a hostage taken,

839
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:47,688
you're faced with two impossible choices
and end up being killed.

840
01:01:49,608 --> 01:01:52,153
On every mission,
you're putting your life on the line.

841
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,821
Look at this...

842
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:58,090
At all the names engraved
on this stone...

843
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:03,054
These are all ninja who are
considered "heroes" of our village.

844
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,806
That's it! That's it!
That's it! That's it! I like that!

845
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:11,399
I've decided! I'm gonna get my name
engraved on that stone, too!

846
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:16,135
A hero! A hero!
I'm not going to die like a dog!

847
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:19,658
But... they're not just ordinary heroes.

848
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,990
Really? Then what kind
of heroes are they?!

849
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,412
Hey! Hey!

850
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,337
They are all heroes
who died in the line of duty.

851
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:41,277
This is a memorial.

852
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:45,054
The names of my best friends
are also engraved here...

853
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:01,612
I'll give you guys one more chance!

854
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:05,783
However,
it will be much harder this time.

855
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:08,551
Those who want to take on
the challenge can eat lunch.

856
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,953
But don't let Naruto have any.

857
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:16,252
It's his punishment for
attempting to eat lunch on his own.

858
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,004
If either of you feeds him...

859
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:21,674
that person will be disqualified
on the spot.

860
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:27,221
My word is law here.
Got it?

861
01:03:45,002 --> 01:03:46,002
Here.

862
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,264
H-Hey, Sasuke.
But Sensei just said...

863
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:55,124
It's okay.
There's no sign of him now.

864
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,043
The three of us are going to go
take the bells together.

865
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:01,797
It'll be a problem if he just slows us down.

866
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:04,102
<i>Sasuke...</i>

867
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:15,233
It... can't be!

868
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:17,429
This is more than just a rumor.

869
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,933
Kakashi's test might
be a bit difficult...

870
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:26,930
I get that it's difficult, but... no one?
Not a single person has ever passed?

871
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:28,250
That's right...

872
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:31,963
Kakashi has never passed a student.

873
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,339
They have all...

874
01:04:33,617 --> 01:04:34,910
been annihilated...

875
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,127
You three!

876
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:41,936
Yiiikes!

877
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:48,802
You broke the rules!
Prepare yourselves for the consequence!

878
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:56,644
Do you have... anything to say?

879
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:07,947
You pass!

880
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:08,989
What?!

881
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,490
What?!

882
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:13,827
You pass!

883
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,249
We passed?! Why?!

884
01:05:19,463 --> 01:05:20,923
You guys are the first.

885
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:26,048
Up until now, everyone I've tested were
just fools who blindly followed the rules.

886
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,678
A ninja must see through deception...

887
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:32,502
In the world of ninja,

888
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:35,488
those who break rules and disobey orders
are scum...

889
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:37,684
But...

890
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:42,752
Those who abandon their friends
are worse than scum.

891
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:53,192
He's... He's... kind of... cool...

892
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,868
That's it for the exercise...

893
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:57,246
Everyone passes!

894
01:05:57,947 --> 01:06:00,491
Team 7 begins its missions tomorrow!

895
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,542
Yes!

896
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:09,461
I did it! I'm a ninja!
Ninja! Ninja!

897
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,467
Let's go home.

898
01:06:16,846 --> 01:06:18,348
<i>Cha!</i>

899
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,561
I...

900
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,731
I knew this would happen!

901
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,737
Untie the rope!
