1
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,759
Sasuke, at Point B!

2
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,848
<i>Sakura, at Point C!</i>

3
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,905
<i>Naruto, at Point A!</i>

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,479
<i>You're slow, Naruto!</i>

5
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,124
<i>Okay, Team 7...</i>

6
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,149
<i>Hm?!</i>

7
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,192
<i>The target has moved!</i>

8
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,319
<i>Follow it!</i>

9
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:56,345
What's your distance to the target?

10
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,037
Five meters! I'm ready to go!

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,081
I'm ready too!

12
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:04,806
Me too...!

13
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,875
Okay...

14
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,204
Do it!

15
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,590
Uryaaah!

16
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,009
I got him!

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,571
<i>Does he have the ribbon
on his right ear...?</i>

18
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,097
<i>Is that our target, Tora?</i>

19
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,392
It's the target, no mistake.

20
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,480
Alright, the mission to capture the
lost pet, Tora, is complete!

21
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:34,821
Ohhh! My cute Tora!
I was worried to death!

22
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,575
Serves that stupid cat right!

23
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,870
No wonder he ran away...

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,996
Now, then!

25
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,792
The next mission for
Kakashi's Team 7 is...

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,331
An errand in the neighboring town...
babysitting the Chief Councilor's son...

27
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,279
Helping dig up potatoes...

28
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
Nooooo!

29
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,735
No! No, thank you!

30
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,907
As for me,

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,643
I wanna do a much cooler mission!

32
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,109
Give us something else!

33
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:08,653
<i>He's got a point...</i>

34
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,672
<i>Man... He's such a pain!</i>

35
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,235
<i>I figured it was about time
for him to get worked up.</i>

36
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:19,064
You idiot! You're still rookies!

37
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,612
Every ninja starts...

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,780
with these simple missions

39
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,726
to gain experience
and work their way up!

40
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,336
B-But!

41
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,999
But we've only had a bunch
of lame missions so far!

42
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
Knock it off!

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,045
Naruto!

44
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,911
Let me explain to you
how missions work.

45
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,261
Listen to me!

46
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,225
Requests pour into the village
every day.

47
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,758
They range from babysitting
to assassinations...

48
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:54,597
A wide spectrum of requests
are compiled into a list...

49
00:03:54,901 --> 00:04:00,448
They're classified into Ranks
A, B, C, and D based on difficulty.

50
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,732
All the ninja in our village...

51
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:09,346
are ranked by ability:
Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.

52
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:14,020
We, the higher-ups,
assign these requests as missions

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,340
to ninja of the appropriate
skill level.

54
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:24,764
And, upon a mission's success,
we receive payment from the client.

55
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:30,170
Since you have just become Genin...

56
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:33,202
D-Rank missions are all
you can handle for now.

57
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:34,816
Hm?!

58
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,940
Yesterday's lunch was pork-
bone ramen,

59
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,087
so today, it's miso ramen...

60
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,488
Listen!

61
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,483
I-I'm sorry.

62
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:47,117
Ah! You're always lecturing me,
Old Man!

63
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:53,095
But I'm not the little troublemaker
I used to be!

64
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,290
Hmph!

65
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>Man,
I'm gonna get scolded later...</i>

66
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,809
Okay, fine!

67
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:10,518
Huh?!

68
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,325
If you insist...

69
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,225
I will assign you a C-Rank mission.

70
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:19,379
You will be bodyguards.

71
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,902
Really?!

72
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,139
Ah ha!

73
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,286
Who is it? Who is it?

74
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:24,842
A feudal lord?!

75
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,811
Or a princess?!

76
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,465
Don't get so hasty.

77
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,461
I'll introduce you now!

78
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,369
Could you please come in...?

79
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,924
What's this?
A bunch of snot-nosed kids!

80
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:45,838
Huh?

81
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,567
Especially you, the short one
with the stupid face.

82
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,898
Are you really a ninja?

83
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:01,230
Who's the short one with
the stupid-looking face?

84
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:02,871
Huh?

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,860
I'll kill him!!

86
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,341
You can't kill the client

87
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,159
you're supposed to be
protecting, you idiot?!

88
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:16,376
I am Tazuna,
a master bridge builder.

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,435
You'll be guarding me with
your lives

90
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:24,622
until I return to my land and
complete the bridge!

91
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,996
We're off!!

92
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,599
What are you so excited about?!

93
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,913
You see, I've never been outside
the village before!

94
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,014
Hey! You expect me to believe
this little runt can protect me?!

95
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:45,876
I'm a Jonin, so I'll be in charge.
There's no need to worry.

96
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,409
<i>This little runt?!</i>

97
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:52,007
Hey, Old Man!

98
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,122
Don't you dare mock ninja!

99
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,053
I'm awesome, you see!

100
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,502
And I'm a super-elite ninja who
is going to be Hokage someday!

101
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,337
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

102
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,568
Don't you forget it!

103
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,053
The Hokage's the top ninja
in the village, right?

104
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:13,000
You sure don't look like
Hokage material to me...

105
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,326
Aaah! Shut up!

106
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,510
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to become the Hokage!

107
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:24,542
Then, you're going to have to
acknowledge my strength!

108
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,448
I'll never acknowledge you, runt...

109
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,075
Even if you become the Hokage!

110
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,565
What?! I'll kill you!

111
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,788
I told you to stop that, you idiot!

112
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,565
C'mon! Just let me at him!
Just one punch!

113
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,163
Say... Mr. Tazuna...?

114
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:48,753
What is it?

115
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:52,071
Your country is
the Land of Waves, right?

116
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,640
What of it?

117
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,672
Say, Kakashi-sensei...

118
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,761
Are there ninja in that land, too?

119
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:02,035
No, there aren't ninja in
the Land of Waves...

120
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:07,415
But in other nations, while cultures
and customs are different,

121
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,536
Hidden Villages exist,
and there are ninja there.

122
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:16,882
For most nations on the continent,

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,292
Hidden Villages are a measure
of their nation's military strength.

124
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,519
In other words,

125
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,215
that's how nations maintain
relations with their neighbors.

126
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,720
However, a Hiden Village is not
subservient to its nation.

127
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,348
They hold equal standing.

128
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,660
On a small island like
the Land of Waves,

129
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,996
where it is difficult to be
influenced by other nations,

130
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,734
there is no need
for a Hidden Village.

131
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,838
Among the respective nations
that possess a Hidden Village,

132
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:57,762
the nations of Fire, Water,
Lightning, Wind, and Earth

133
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,723
are known as the
Five Great Shinobi Nations.

134
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,788
They are recognized for
their large territories and vast power.

135
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,041
The Hidden Leaf Village
of the Land of Fire.

136
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,049
The Village Hidden in the Mist
of the Land of Water.

137
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,039
The Village Hidden in the Clouds
of the Land of Lightning.

138
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,721
The Village Hidden in the Sand
of the Land of Wind.

139
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,015
The Village Hidden in the Stone
of the Land of Earth.

140
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,936
Only the leaders of
each of these Hidden Villages

141
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:24,417
are permitted the title of
"Kage", meaning Shadow.

142
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,775
"Hokage" (Fire Shadow),

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,068
"Mizukage" (Water Shadow),

144
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,212
"Raikage" (Lightning Shadow),

145
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,362
"Kazekage" (Wind Shadow),

146
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,487
"Tsuchikage" (Earth Shadow).

147
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
The five Kage (Five Shadows),

148
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,361
they reign supreme over
tens of thousands of shinobi

149
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:39,929
in each nation across the world.

150
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,486
Well... don't worry.

151
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,836
It's not likely there'll be any
ninja battles on a C-Rank mission.

152
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,752
So, we don't have to worry about
fighting any enemy ninja, right?

153
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,049
Of course not.

154
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,258
What?!

155
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,009
Huh?!

156
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,469
W-What?

157
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
The first one!

158
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,067
K-Kakashi-sensei!

159
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,959
Hm?!

160
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>It won't come off!</i>

161
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,050
<i>W-Wow!!</i>

162
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:21,157
Whoa!

163
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:22,004
Ugh!!

164
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,181
<i>They're coming!</i>

165
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,393
<i>I have to do something...
I have to!!</i>

166
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,240
Get back!

167
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:37,493
Yo...

168
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,767
<i>Kakashi-sensei! He's alive!</i>

169
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,952
<i>Hmph. Show-off.</i>

170
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:46,514
What?!

171
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,814
Then, what was that...?

172
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:55,162
Naruto, sorry I didn't help you
right away.

173
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:57,206
You got hurt.

174
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:02,700
I didn't expect you to freeze up like that.

175
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,042
Anyway, good job, Sasuke.

176
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,541
You too, Sakura.

177
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>I... couldn't do anything...</i>

178
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,284
<i>but Sasuke...</i>

179
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>It was his first real battle...</i>

180
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,362
<i>Didn't he feel scared, at all?</i>

181
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,883
<i>He saved me like it was nothing...
and didn't even get his clothes dirty.</i>

182
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:28,806
Hey...

183
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,831
Huh?!

184
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,830
Are you hurt...

185
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,404
Scaredy-cat?

186
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,496
Sasuke!

187
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:40,521
Naruto!

188
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,944
These guys have poison
on their claws.

189
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,734
You need to
extract the poison quickly.

190
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:48,608
What?!

191
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:52,811
You have to open the wound and
drain the poisoned blood.

192
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:54,300
Try not to move around.

193
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,717
The poison will spread.

194
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:58,224
By the way, Mr. Tazuna...

195
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,293
W-What is it...?!

196
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,862
I need to speak with you.

197
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,638
Chunin from the
Village Hidden in the Mist...

198
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:15,045
These ninja are known to continue
fighting, no matter the cost.

199
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,939
How were you able
to detect our movements?

200
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,234
There probably wouldn't be
puddles of water

201
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:26,739
on a clear day like this, when 
it hasn't rained in days.

202
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,410
If you knew, why did you let
the kids engage them first?

203
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,248
If I wanted to, I could have
kill them in an instant...

204
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,295
But...
I had to know...

205
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,091
who their target was...

206
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,053
Hm?! What do you mean?

207
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:51,231
What I mean is,

208
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,926
I had to know if
their target was you,

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,064
or if they were after us shinobi.

210
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:05,903
We didn't hear anything about
you being targeted by ninja.

211
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:09,924
The extent of your request was
supposed to be

212
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,952
protection from
ordinary thugs and thieves...

213
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:18,349
Our mission was to guard you
until the bridge is completed...

214
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,353
But if our enemies were to be ninja,

215
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,253
this mission would be B-Rank or higher,
which is more expensive.

216
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,910
You may have had your reasons...

217
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,973
but lying on a mission request
is unacceptable.

218
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,142
This is beyond the scope
of our mission.

219
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,146
This mission is too difficult for us...

220
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,016
We should call it off!

221
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:46,164
We need an anesthetic
for Naruto's wound

222
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,445
and to drain the poisoned blood...

223
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,238
Hm? What?!

224
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:54,915
This is a problem!

225
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:58,833
Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,
shall we go back to the village...?

226
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:06,880
Huh!

227
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:07,690
Oh!

228
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:15,389
Why am I so different?!

229
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,868
Why's it always me...
Damn it!

230
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:22,396
Naruto! What are you doing?!

231
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,942
I should be getting stronger...

232
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,627
I've been steadily carrying
out missions and

233
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,461
doing my own special training
every day...

234
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:40,706
I'll never let anyone
have to save me again!

235
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,996
I'll never freeze up,
or run away...

236
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,297
I won't lose to Sasuke...

237
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,731
I swear on the pain in this hand!
Believe it!

238
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:59,290
I'll protect you with this kunai, Old Man!

239
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,067
The mission continues!

240
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:09,877
Naruto...

241
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:12,946
Getting the poison out is one thing,

242
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,693
but if you keep that up,
you'll bleed to death.

243
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,432
You're going to bleed to death
if you don't stop that... Seriously!

244
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,606
Argh! No! No!

245
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,883
I don't wanna die like this, y'know!

246
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,718
Show me your hand.

247
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:37,362
Nooo! Help me!!

248
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,387
Naruto!

249
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,891
You're so reckless,
aren't you!

250
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:42,893
You're unbelievable!

251
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,247
<i>The wound is...</i>

252
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:53,298
<i>already starting to heal...</i>

253
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,213
Did you say you failed?!

254
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,313
I paid a lot of money to hire
you guys

255
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:13,030
because you said
you were elite ninja!

256
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,552
Stop your damn grumbling...

257
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:26,937
Next time, I'll kill him myself...

258
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:31,567
I-It's really okay, right?!

259
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:35,445
It seems that the enemy
has hired some good ninja...

260
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:40,259
Now that the Demon Brothers have failed,
our target will be on high alert.

261
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,077
It won't be easy...

262
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,955
Just who do you think I am?!

263
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,671
I am Zabuza Momochi,
the Demon of the Hidden Mist.

264
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,529
This is quite some fog.
I can't see ahead.

265
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,031
The bridge should be visible soon.

266
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,128
When we reach the other side of the
bridge, we'll be in the Land of Waves.

267
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,650
Wooow!
It's huge!

268
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:50,354
H-Hey!
Please keep it down.

269
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,183
The fog is the only reason
we've made it this far undetected.

270
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,612
Engine’s off—been rowing to stay quiet.

271
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,644
If they find us now,
we'll be in deep trouble.

272
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,495
Mr. Tazuna.

273
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,683
I want to ask you something
before we arrive at the pier.

274
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,512
Who is after you?
And why are they targeting you?

275
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,617
If you don't tell us...

276
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:30,957
this mission may end the moment
we reach the shore.

277
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,067
It appears I have no choice
but to tell you.

278
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,112
No, I'd like you to know.

279
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,919
Just as you said,

280
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:46,333
this is probably beyond
the scope of your mission.

281
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,915
I am being targeted
by a terrifying man.

282
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,338
Who?

283
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:57,203
You guys have probably heard
of him before.

284
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:03,153
A shipping magnate
by the name of Gato.

285
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:07,141
What? Gato... of the Gato Company?

286
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,794
One of the world's richest men?

287
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,563
On the surface, he's the chief executive
of a shipping company...

288
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,962
But underneath, he's
involved in drug trafficking

289
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:21,115
and contraband, using gangs
and ninja to do his dirty work.

290
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,572
He runs a despicable business,

291
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,399
and ruthlessly takes over businesses
and even entire nations.

292
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,041
It was about one year ago...

293
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,711
when that man first set his eyes on
the Land of Waves...

294
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:41,757
He used his wealth and violence
to enter this country,

295
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,525
and before anyone knew it,

296
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,555
he'd taken complete control of the
island's shipping and transport.

297
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:54,488
In an island nation like the Land of Waves,
controlling the seas...

298
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:58,725
means having control of finance,
the government, the people... everything.

299
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:02,756
The one thing Gato fears...

300
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:06,406
is the completion of the bridge.

301
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,740
But I don't understand.

302
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,038
Your opponent is a dangerous man,
who even uses ninja.

303
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:16,060
Why did you hide that fact from us
when you made your request?

304
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,627
The Land of Waves...

305
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:24,984
is a very poor nation.
Even our feudal lord has no money.

306
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:30,028
We can't afford a B-Rank mission
or higher.

307
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:35,727
Well, if you pull out
of the mission when I land ashore,

308
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:38,768
I will, no doubt, be killed.

309
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,817
Killed before I even make it home.

310
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,311
But there's no need for concern!

311
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:50,016
Should I die, my cute grandchild,
who will turn eight...

312
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:53,365
will only cry his heart out!

313
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:54,830
Oh!

314
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:59,399
And... my daughter will only blame
the Hidden Leaf ninja

315
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:03,932
for the rest of her life
and live in sorrow!

316
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:09,981
Well...

317
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,483
I guess we have no choice.

318
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,265
Let's continue as his bodyguards.

319
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,016
<i>I won!</i>

320
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,314
We'll be arriving soon.

321
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:22,482
Tazuna.

322
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,569
It appears we haven't been noticed yet...

323
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,362
Thanks.

324
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:55,753
This is as far as I go.

325
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,281
See you around.

326
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,993
Yeah. You've been a big help.

327
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,011
Be careful.

328
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,127
Okay!

329
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:18,762
Get me home safely.

330
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,067
Right.

331
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:25,996
<i>The next one won't be a Chunin.
It'll be a Jonin.</i>

332
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:28,413
<i>Damn!</i>

333
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,252
<i>I'm not gonna let this guy
get all the action!</i>

334
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:50,417
There!

335
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:56,099
Heh... Just a mouse.

336
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:58,498
Quit trying to show off!

337
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,816
There was nothing there
in the first place!

338
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,348
Please, Naruto.

339
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:04,251
Don't use kunai recklessly.

340
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,635
They're really dangerous.

341
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,444
Hey, brat!
Stop messing around!

342
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,815
Huh? I sense a presence there!

343
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:13,221
There!

344
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,706
Stop it, already!

345
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,310
S-Someone's really been targeting us
the whole time!

346
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,812
Yeah, right!

347
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,214
Knock it off, you!

348
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,174
Naruto!
What have you done?!

349
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,608
It's a bunny!

350
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:35,532
I-I didn't mean to...
Sorry, bunny.

351
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:37,117
It's just a rabbit, huh.

352
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,527
<i>That's a snow rabbit.</i>

353
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:43,837
<i>But that doesn't explain
its fur color...</i>

354
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:48,955
<i>The coat turns white only during winter
when there is little sunlight.</i>

355
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,201
<i>Which means...</i>

356
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:57,272
<i>that this Snow Rabbit was raised
to be used as a substitution.</i>

357
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,958
<i>Guess they're already here...</i>

358
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,694
<i>I see... The Demon Brothers wouldn't
be enough to take on these guys.</i>

359
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,977
<i>The Copy Ninja of the
Hidden Leaf Village...</i>

360
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,826
<i>Sharingan Kakashi is with them...</i>

361
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:38,202
<i>If I'm not mistaken, he's...</i>

362
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,229
<i>I'm going to do it this time...</i>

363
00:25:40,254 --> 00:25:42,215
<i>I won't lose to Sasuke!</i>

364
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:44,985
Well, well...

365
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,931
If it isn't Zabuza Momochi,
the Rogue Ninja of the Hidden Mist!

366
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:50,690
<i>Ready...</i>

367
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,408
<i>Go!</i>

368
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:54,633
Get back, you guys.

369
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:57,937
He's on a completely different level
than the ones we fought before.

370
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,051
If he's our opponent, then...

371
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:03,251
Huh?

372
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:04,276
Oh.

373
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,855
This is going to be tough.

374
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:10,928
Sharingan Kakashi, I presume?

375
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,632
Sorry, but...

376
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:18,414
Could you hand over the old man?

377
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,468
<i>H-Huh? Sharingan?
What's that?</i>

378
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:28,674
Form the Manji Formation...

379
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,188
Protect Tazuna.

380
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,731
Stay out of this fight.

381
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,959
That's the teamwork
this situation demands.

382
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:38,709
Huh?!

383
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:42,820
Fight me.

384
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,208
<i>W-What's up with his eye...?</i>

385
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:49,230
Well now...

386
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:52,842
I never expected to see
the legendary Sharingan this soon...

387
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,295
This is an honor.

388
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,952
Everyone's been saying Sharingan...

389
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:58,372
What is it?!

390
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,329
... Sharingan.

391
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:04,238
It's a special power that can see
through movements and copies techniques.

392
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:10,027
The Sharingan is a dojutsu—a type of
visual jutsu that manifests in the eyes.

393
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:15,409
However, that is not the only power
the Sharingan has...

394
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:19,237
Well said.

395
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,199
There is indeed more...

396
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:29,456
When I was in the ANBU Black Ops
of the Hidden Mist,

397
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:31,999
I had a shinobi Bingo Book...

398
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,610
You were among those I had intel on.

399
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,089
You have quite an impressive record...

400
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:41,847
The man who has copied
over one thousand jutsu...

401
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:44,004
Kakashi, the Copy Ninja.

402
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:49,033
<i>What? Kakashi-sensei
is really that incredible?</i>

403
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:51,517
W-Wow!

404
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:55,707
<i>The Sharingan... is a special trait</i>

405
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,930
<i>that appears in only a select few
among the Uchiha clan.</i>

406
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,653
<i>Could he be...</i>

407
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,491
Let's end the talking here.

408
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:08,328
I must kill that old man immediately.

409
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:20,298
But, Kakashi, it seems
I have to defeat you first.

410
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:29,098
Over there!

411
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:30,166
And he's on the water?

412
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,270
<i>He's building up quite a bit of chakra!</i>

413
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:37,723
<i>Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu.</i>

414
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:42,953
He vanished?!

415
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:46,157
He'll probably come to kill me first...

416
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,826
What is he?

417
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:49,628
Zabuza Momochi.

418
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:52,413
He's an ANBU Black Ops member
of the Hidden Mist

419
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,274
and he's an expert of the
Silent Killing technique.

420
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,460
So don't lower your guard, you guys.

421
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,543
The mist is steadily getting thicker!

422
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,351
The Land of Waves
is surrounded by ocean.

423
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,895
The mist builds up quickly here.

424
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,274
Sensei!

425
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:23,654
<i>Eight spots.</i>

426
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:25,591
Huh? What?

427
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,659
<i>The larynx, the spine,
the lungs, the liver...</i>

428
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:32,871
<i>the jugular, the subclavian veins,</i>

429
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,582
<i>the kidneys, and the heart...</i>

430
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:39,449
<i>Now then, which vital spot
should I choose?</i>

431
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,304
<i>What an intense killing intent!</i>

432
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,747
<i>If I take even one breath,
or move my eyes,</i>

433
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:57,185
<i>I will be marked and killed...
That's what I'm feeling.</i>

434
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:01,232
<i>I can't! I'd rather die
than face this feeling!</i>

435
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:03,307
Sasuke.

436
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,739
Calm down.
I'll protect you with my life.

437
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:13,077
I will not allow
my comrades to be killed.

438
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,112
I wonder about that...

439
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:17,931
It's over.

440
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,449
Sensei!
Behind you!

441
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:40,577
Die!

442
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,695
<i>A Water Clone Jutsu?</i>

443
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,447
<i>It can't be!</i>

444
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:58,798
Don't move.

445
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,050
It's over.

446
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:02,835
Wow!

447
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,837
Did you say it's over?

448
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:15,429
You don't understand, do you?

449
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:20,157
You'll never defeat me with
such a cheap imitation.

450
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,275
No chance.

451
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,317
But, I must say you're good.

452
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:33,024
You had already copied my
Water Clone Jutsu back then, huh?

453
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,745
<i>I will not allow
my comrades to be killed.</i>

454
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:45,795
You used the clone to take your place,
and create a diversion.

455
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:52,635
While you used the Hidden Mist Jutsu
to hide yourself and watch me...

456
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,345
But...

457
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:57,598
I'm not a fool.

458
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:09,151
<i>Now!</i>

459
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:14,247
<i>Makibishi spikes.</i>

460
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,120
How foolish!

461
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,420
<i>W-What's with this water...?
It's awfully heavy.</i>

462
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,877
Hmph... Fool!

463
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:32,008
<i>Water Prison Jutsu!</i>

464
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,467
<i>Damn!</i>

465
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,074
<i>My escape into the water...</i>

466
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,345
<i>was a huge mistake!</i>

467
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:43,603
You're caught...

468
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,481
This prison is special.
There's no escaping it!

469
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,442
I'll settle things
with you later.

470
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:53,798
After I finish those guys off.

471
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:56,282
<i>Water Clone Jutsu!</i>

472
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:59,304
<i>I didn't expect this level of skill...</i>

473
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,967
Acting all tough with that
headband...

474
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:19,407
But... a true ninja is one

475
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:23,142
who has danced on the edge of death
countless times.

476
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,163
In other words,

477
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,481
only those whose names are worthy
of being listed in my Bingo Book,

478
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,818
deserve to be called ninja.

479
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:36,793
You brats don't even deserve
to be called ninja.

480
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:38,907
<i>He disappeared again!</i>

481
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:49,585
You're just a kid!

482
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:51,824
Naruto!

483
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,426
You three!
Take Tazuna and run!

484
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:59,303
You have no chance
against this guy!

485
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:02,603
As long as he has me trapped
in this Water Prison,

486
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:04,046
he can't leave this spot.

487
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,202
The Water Clone also can't stray too far

488
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,354
from the user's real body.

489
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,481
So just run for now!

490
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,655
Sasuke!

491
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:20,388
Sasuke...

492
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:28,791
<i>T-This is a Jonin-level...
A real ninja...</i>

493
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:31,892
<i>Seriously! Seriously!</i>

494
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:33,128
<i>We're going to be killed!!</i>

495
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,084
Ow!

496
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:02,742
<i>Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.</i>

497
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:07,374
<i>Congratulations on your graduation.</i>

498
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,969
<i>On top of having a hostage taken,</i>

499
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:12,663
<i>you're faced with two impossible choices
and end up being killed.</i>

500
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,212
<i>On every mission,
you're putting your life on the line.</i>

501
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,551
<i>You pass!</i>

502
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:26,474
<i>I'm not the little prankster
you think I am anymore!</i>

503
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:28,963
<i>I'm going to surpass the Hokage!</i>

504
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,419
<i>And then the entire Village</i>

505
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,738
<i>will have to acknowledge my existence!</i>

506
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:37,299
<i>That's right...</i>

507
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:41,030
<i>I'm a ninja now. And...</i>

508
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,780
<i>I decided that I was not going
to freeze up!</i>

509
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:47,089
<i>That I wouldn't run away!</i>

510
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,544
Hmph! Idiot...

511
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,821
What are you thinking...
charging off on your own?!

512
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:06,688
Even Sasuke is no match for him...

513
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:11,237
No matter how hard we try,
we Genin are no match for him...

514
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,317
<i>Huh?!</i>

515
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
<i>The headband...?!</i>

516
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,426
Hey, No-Brows!

517
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:53,073
Make a record in your Bingo Book...

518
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:57,510
a man who will one day be Hokage
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

519
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,593
The Hidden Leaf Village's very own...

520
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:03,280
Naruto Uzumaki!

521
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:11,746
<i>When I first saw that little kid,
he seemed so unreliable...</i>

522
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,061
Sasuke! I have a plan!

523
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,249
What is it?

524
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:17,668
I have a plan.

525
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,589
Hmph! Teamwork, you say?

526
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,384
<i>W-What is this feeling?</i>

527
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:28,012
<i>Was Naruto always so...?</i>

528
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,428
Now...

529
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,184
Let's do this!

530
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,841
Big words for a brat.
Let's see if you can back them up.

531
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,577
<i>T-This isn't good...</i>

532
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,430
What are you guys doing!
I told you to run!

533
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,240
It was obvious what was going to happen
once I was caught!

534
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Hurry! Run!

535
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:53,224
Listen to me!
Our mission is to protect Tazuna!

536
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,122
Have you forgotten that?!

537
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,282
Old Man...

538
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:00,785
Well...

539
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:04,286
I got you into this...

540
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:08,112
And it would be wrong to let
you four get killed trying to save me.

541
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,307
Sorry, you guys...

542
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:13,922
Fight as much as you want!

543
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:16,987
You hear that?

544
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:19,739
Are you ready?

545
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:32,173
You guys really haven't learned
anything, have you?

546
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:33,979
W-What?!

547
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:37,319
You're still playing at being ninja.

548
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:41,191
When I was your age,

549
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:45,015
these hands were already
stained with blood!

550
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,153
Zabuza, the Demon!

551
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:53,960
Ohh? So you've heard...?

552
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,259
Long ago, the Hidden Mist Village was
known as the "Village of the Bloody Mist."

553
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:05,125
Ninja candidates faced
their greatest challenge.

554
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:10,948
You even know about
the graduation exam...?

555
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:13,338
The graduation exam?

556
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,547
What is it?

557
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,751
This graduation exam
that you're talking about...

558
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,773
The students killed each other.

559
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:29,319
What?

560
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,433
Classmates who had shared rice
from the same pot

561
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,710
formed pairs and tried
to kill each other.

562
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,938
It didn't end
until one of them died.

563
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:49,679
Friends who used to talk about
each other's dreams and aspirations...

564
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,264
How cruel...

565
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,076
Ten years ago,

566
00:39:56,368 --> 00:40:00,956
the Mist Village's graduation exam
was forced to undergo drastic reform.

567
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:07,505
Because an evil demon had appeared
on the scene the previous year.

568
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:09,585
What about the reform?

569
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:12,554
What had that evil demon done?

570
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:17,288
With no scruples or hesitation...

571
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:21,519
a young boy who hadn't even
yet qualified as a ninja,

572
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:26,816
butchered more than one hundred
of his fellow students.

573
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:34,187
That sure was... fun...

574
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,466
Sasuke!

575
00:40:56,669 --> 00:40:57,669
Die!

576
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,365
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

577
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:09,360
Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,
and so many of them.

578
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,319
Here I go!

579
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,501
It's impossible, after all...

580
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,550
<i>There's only one way left
to defeat this guy!</i>

581
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:36,156
Sasuke!

582
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,159
<i>I see!</i>

583
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,467
<i>So that's your plan, Naruto!</i>

584
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,394
<i>That's pretty good for you!</i>

585
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:57,272
<i>Demon Wind Shuriken</i>

586
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:01,187
A shuriken won't work on me.

587
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:11,132
<i>I see.</i>

588
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:14,718
<i>This time you're
aiming for my real body...</i>

589
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,090
<i>But...</i>

590
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:18,348
<i>It's not so easy!</i>

591
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:23,313
<i>A second shuriken hidden
in the shadow of the first one!</i>

592
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,144
<i>But...</i>

593
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,356
<i>Still too naïve.</i>

594
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:38,812
Gotcha!

595
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:53,170
You little brat!

596
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,601
Kakashi-sensei!

597
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
Naruto...

598
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,322
Your strategy was outstanding.

599
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:14,902
You've grown up...
Both of you.

600
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:20,513
The purpose of the Shadow Clones
was not to take down Zabuza,

601
00:43:20,883 --> 00:43:25,637
but to hide me, transformed
into a Demon Wind Shuriken!

602
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:27,527
That was just luck...

603
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:29,939
It was just luck, huh!

604
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:33,972
<i>Still, they performed flawlessly
as a team...</i>

605
00:43:33,997 --> 00:43:35,546
<i>in this desperate situation.</i>

606
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,032
<i>Despite the fact...</i>

607
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:40,305
<i>that those two always
fight like cats and dogs.</i>

608
00:43:41,144 --> 00:43:41,811
Hmph...

609
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,305
I got distracted and
released my Water Prison Jutsu...

610
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:46,715
That's not it!

611
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,985
You didn't drop the jutsu...

612
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,428
They forced you to break it.

613
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:56,678
I'll say this once: the same
jutsu won't work on me twice.

614
00:43:57,777 --> 00:43:59,070
So what will you do?

615
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:18,588
<i>Ox, Monkey, Hare.
Rat, Boar, Bird, Ox.</i>

616
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,189
<i>Ox, Monkey, Hare.
Rat, Boar, Bird, Ox.</i>

617
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:25,972
<i>Hand sign: Bird</i>

618
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:30,514
<i>Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!</i>

619
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:52,658
<i>He copied all that in seconds...</i>

620
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,187
<i>and so perfectly...!</i>

621
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,099
<i>Strange...</i>

622
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:13,790
<i>We performed the jutsu
at the exact same time!</i>

623
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:17,161
<i>He couldn't be...</i>

624
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,318
<i>This guy...</i>

625
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:38,948
<i>My movements...!</i>

626
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:41,683
<i>He's perfectly...</i>

627
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,405
Reading them.

628
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:45,467
<i>What?</i>

629
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:48,220
<i>He's reading my mind?!</i>

630
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:53,851
<i>Blast him! He's...</i>

631
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,896
You're trying to intimidate me
with that cold stare... Right?

632
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,869
Hah! You're just copying...
You're a pale imitation.

633
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:08,926
- You won't be able to beat me!
- You won't be able to beat me!

634
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:10,027
- You!
- You!

635
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:15,122
I'll shut that copycat
monkey mouth permanently!

636
00:46:19,768 --> 00:46:20,977
<i>W-What's that!</i>

637
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:26,197
<i>Me?</i>

638
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,635
<i>R-Ridiculous!</i>

639
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:31,718
<i>Is this genjutsu?</i>

640
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,996
<i>Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu!</i>

641
00:46:38,803 --> 00:46:40,137
W-What!

642
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,903
No way!

643
00:46:55,057 --> 00:46:57,727
<i>I was just about to
use that jutsu...</i>

644
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:04,657
<i>I can't keep up with...</i>

645
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,423
<i>his jutsu!</i>

646
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:47,838
It's over...

647
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Why...?

648
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:12,056
Are you able to see into the future...?

649
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:13,108
Yeah...
I see...

650
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,784
Your death!

651
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:42,728
You were right. He is dead.

652
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:18,847
He's definitely dead.

653
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,407
I thank you.

654
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:31,485
I have been waiting for the chance
to kill Zabuza.

655
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,573
By the looks of that mask...

656
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:39,691
You're a Tracker Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Mist.

657
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:44,313
Impressive.
You're very knowledgeable.

658
00:49:44,837 --> 00:49:49,508
<i>Judging by his build and voice,
he can't be much older than Naruto...</i>

659
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,182
<i>And he's a Tracker Ninja...?</i>

660
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:02,724
<i>He's not an ordinary kid...</i>

661
00:50:14,026 --> 00:50:16,947
What are you?!

662
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:26,469
Hey you!

663
00:50:27,596 --> 00:50:30,599
Relax, Naruto.
He's not an enemy.

664
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:33,673
That's not what I'm asking!

665
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,008
I...

666
00:50:35,654 --> 00:50:36,947
I mean!

667
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,340
That Zabuza...
That Zabuza was killed!

668
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:42,848
That guy who was so strong...

669
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:46,810
And he was killed so easily
by a kid no older than me!

670
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,770
I won't accept it!

671
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:51,637
Well,

672
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:53,747
I understand your disbelief.

673
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:57,279
But... this, too, is reality.

674
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,858
In this world, there are kids
who are younger than you...

675
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,736
and stronger than me.

676
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:34,679
Your battle is over for now.

677
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:38,516
I must dispose of this body...

678
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,090
It holds many secrets.

679
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,284
Now then, please excuse me.

680
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:50,539
He disappeared!

681
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,965
Our mission hasn't ended yet.

682
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:01,673
We must get Tazuna safely to his home.

683
00:52:03,863 --> 00:52:05,991
So sorry, everyone!

684
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,026
You can rest at my house!

685
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:10,849
Okay!

686
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:12,143
Let's perk up and go!

687
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:24,372
W-What!

688
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:25,492
What happened!

689
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,411
Kakashi-sensei!

690
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:38,323
Kakashi-sensei!

691
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,981
<i>It seems I've overused
my Sharingan...</i>

692
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,649
Are you alright, Sensei?

693
00:52:58,149 --> 00:53:02,279
I overdid it... I won't be able
to move properly for about a week.

694
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:03,697
Well...

695
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,575
Then you shouldn't move at all.

696
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:07,908
O-Okay...

697
00:53:12,183 --> 00:53:14,636
Hey! Sensei's awake.

698
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,209
Come on!

699
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,117
Your Sharingan is fantastic,

700
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:21,830
but if it puts that much strain
on your body, is it really worth it?

701
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:23,491
S-Sorry...

702
00:53:23,878 --> 00:53:25,088
But you know...

703
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,906
He took down a powerful ninja!

704
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:30,033
We probably don't need to
worry for a while.

705
00:53:30,348 --> 00:53:34,436
Anyway, that kid with the mask...
What was he?

706
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:37,647
He was an ANBU Black Ops
from the Hidden Mist Village.

707
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:40,817
Only elite Tracker Ninja 
wear masks like that.

708
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,101
Tracker Ninja?

709
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,114
Well, they're commonly known as
"Corpse Disposal Unit,"

710
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:50,660
and their duty is to erase every trace
of a ninja's existence.

711
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,055
The body of a ninja reveals
a variety of things...

712
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,793
Ninjutsu secrets and chakra
characteristics of their village...

713
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:02,756
the composition of secret medicines
used on a ninja's body, for example.

714
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,343
For instance, if I were to die,

715
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:10,013
every secret about my Sharingan
would be investigated thoroughly,

716
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,465
and in the worst case scenario,

717
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,577
all of my jutsu could be stolen.

718
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:18,208
In other words,
Tracker Ninja are specialists

719
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:21,236
who prevent village secrets
from leaking out

720
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:24,444
by hunting down rogue ninja
who've fled their village,

721
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,058
and completely eliminating
their bodies.

722
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,041
<i>What is this?</i>

723
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,390
<i>This must mean something...</i>

724
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,278
<i>I have a feeling
I've overlooked something.</i>

725
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,714
What's going on?!
Sensei?

726
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:46,934
Tracker Ninja...

727
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:50,628
dispose of corpses,
immediately, on the spot.

728
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,514
So what?

729
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:57,102
How did that kid in the mask
dispose of Zabuza's body?

730
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,414
How should we know?!

731
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:04,359
That masked guy
took Zabuza away!

732
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,610
That's right...

733
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:11,658
If he needed proof he'd killed Zabuza,
he could simply have taken the head...

734
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:13,993
And then there's...

735
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:18,164
the weapon that Tracker Ninja
used to kill Zabuza...

736
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:20,866
With just a Senbon...

737
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
That's impossible...

738
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:25,901
Yeah... that's impossible!

739
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:31,091
What have you guys
been going on and on about?!

740
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:34,942
It's likely that...
Zabuza is still alive!

741
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:38,768
What the heck do you mean?!

742
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,363
But Kakashi-sensei,
you confirmed that he was dead!

743
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,691
I did confirm it, but...

744
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:49,487
he was probably just in
a death-like state.

745
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:55,545
The senbon that the Tracker Ninja used
has a very low chance of killing...

746
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,871
unless it hits a vital spot.

747
00:55:58,728 --> 00:56:01,314
It's something that was originally
used for medical treatments,

748
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:02,798
such as acupuncture therapy.

749
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:07,381
Tracker Ninja know all about
the structure of the human body...

750
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:12,177
Putting people into a near-death
state is probably simple for them.

751
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:16,639
First, he took the trouble
to carry away Zabuza's body

752
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:18,725
which was probably heavier than he is.

753
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:24,431
Second, he used senbon, a weapon
with a low probability of being fatal.

754
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,266
From these two factors,

755
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:32,197
it's more likely that the kid's goal
wasn't to kill Zabuza, but to save him.

756
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:35,658
Aren't you reading
way too much into it?

757
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,096
No...

758
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:41,279
When something feels wrong,
prepare for the worst.

759
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,666
For a shinobi, that is an ironclad rule.

760
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:54,528
<i>Hmph... To hear that Zabuza
may be alive and to be pleased...</i>

761
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:58,242
Sensei, what can we do to prepare?

762
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:00,817
You won't even be able
to move for a while...

763
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,061
I'm going to have you train!

764
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,358
W-Wait a minute! Even with training,
we're not gonna be that strong!

765
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:13,431
Our opponent is a ninja that even you
had trouble with, despite your Sharingan!

766
00:57:13,675 --> 00:57:16,427
<i>Are you trying to get us killed?!</i>

767
00:57:16,952 --> 00:57:17,952
Sakura...

768
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,979
Who was it that saved me
during my difficult battle?

769
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:25,625
You've all quickly grown...
especially Naruto!

770
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,894
You've grown the most!

771
00:57:30,856 --> 00:57:35,569
So you noticed, Kakashi-sensei!
Now this is getting interesting!

772
00:57:36,029 --> 00:57:37,655
It's not interesting at all...

773
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,962
Who the heck are you?

774
00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:47,855
Hey, Inari!
Where have you been?!

775
00:57:48,327 --> 00:57:49,995
Welcome back... Grandpa...

776
00:57:50,356 --> 00:57:52,525
Inari, what sort of greeting is that?!

777
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:55,775
These are the ninja
who escorted your grandpa!

778
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,616
It's okay, it's okay.
Right, Inari?

779
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,162
But mom, these guys will die...

780
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:06,374
They can't win against Gato
and his men.

781
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:08,418
What did you say, you little brat?!

782
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:10,670
Now listen up!

783
00:58:10,853 --> 00:58:13,514
I'm a superhero who's going to become
an awesome ninja,

784
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:14,707
the one who'll become the Hokage!

785
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,277
I don't care if his name is Gato or
Bonito or whatever...

786
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:19,846
I'm not worried
about those guys at all!

787
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:25,018
Huh! A hero? How stupid.
There's no such thing!

788
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:26,412
What was that?!

789
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,756
Stop that!

790
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:31,107
If you don't want to die,
you'd better hurry up and go home...

791
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,652
Inari, where are you going?

792
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:38,531
To the sea...
I'm going to look at the sea...

793
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:44,706
I apologize.

794
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,085
That brat... I'll teach him
a thing or two!

795
00:58:56,674 --> 00:58:57,674
Huh?

796
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:00,162
<i>Is he crying?!</i>

797
00:59:10,049 --> 00:59:11,425
Dad...

798
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,579
So, now the training begins!

799
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,170
Yes, sir!

800
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:30,081
But... before that, let's go over the
basics of chakra, a ninja's power.

801
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:31,502
Now then...

802
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,640
We already know all about that!
"Chatora", right?

803
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:37,227
It's chakra...

804
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,073
Go ahead, Sakura.

805
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:41,545
Pay attention, Naruto...

806
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:48,310
Chakra is the energy
a ninja needs to perform jutsu!

807
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:50,684
It's made up of two energies:

808
00:59:50,709 --> 00:59:55,255
First, physical energy gathered
from each and every cell in the body

809
00:59:55,798 --> 01:00:02,096
Second, spiritual energy accumulated
with years of training and experience!

810
01:00:02,652 --> 01:00:07,239
In other words, jutsu draws out
and combines these two energies

811
01:00:07,264 --> 01:00:08,599
from within the body,

812
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:11,752
and this is called
"combining chakra."

813
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:17,211
Then chakra is activated
by forming hand signs.

814
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:19,320
That's exactly right!

815
01:00:19,672 --> 01:00:22,967
Iruka-sensei has certainly raised
some fine students.

816
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:28,683
Whatever! I may not understand
difficult explanations,

817
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,614
but I'll just learn it with my body!

818
01:00:30,932 --> 01:00:32,309
Naruto is absolutely right...

819
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,588
We all are
already able to use jutsu...

820
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:39,775
No! None of you are using
your chakra efficiently yet.

821
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:41,177
What?!

822
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:43,272
Just listen...

823
01:00:43,816 --> 01:00:45,526
As Sakura explained earlier,

824
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:50,643
combining chakra means taking
both physical and spiritual energies

825
01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:52,569
and mixing them together
within the body.

826
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:59,476
And the amount of each energy needed

827
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,342
changes based on
the jutsu you want to activate...

828
01:01:02,783 --> 01:01:05,952
Right now, none of you are
using your chakra efficiently!

829
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:10,391
Even if you're able to summon
a lot of chakra,

830
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,352
if you're not able to control it
in a balanced way

831
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,731
not only will the effectiveness
of the jutsu be cut in half

832
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:19,041
but it may not even
be activated at all.

833
01:01:19,578 --> 01:01:23,290
Wasting energy will leave you
unable to fight for long.

834
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:25,817
These are some of
the weaknesses that can occur.

835
01:01:26,493 --> 01:01:28,704
W-What should we do...?

836
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,689
You need to learn to control
chakra with your body!

837
01:01:32,966 --> 01:01:37,513
It's difficult training that requires you
to put your life on the line to master!

838
01:01:39,724 --> 01:01:41,199
W-What will we do?

839
01:01:42,273 --> 01:01:43,273
Hm?

840
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:45,194
Tree climbing...

841
01:01:45,272 --> 01:01:46,607
Tree climbing?!

842
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,020
That's right.

843
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:50,172
But this isn't just ordinary
tree climbing!

844
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:52,535
You will climb
without using your hands.

845
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:54,339
What? How?

846
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,507
Well, just watch.

847
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,774
He's climbing...

848
01:02:16,624 --> 01:02:19,210
Straight up the tree,
and just with his feet!

849
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,365
So see, kind of like this...

850
01:02:25,013 --> 01:02:28,600
Focus chakra to the soles of your
feet and use it to stick to the tree.

851
01:02:29,323 --> 01:02:32,076
If you use chakra well,
you can do things like this.

852
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:33,354
Wait a minute!

853
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:36,283
How does something like that
make you strong?

854
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:38,784
I was just about to get to that...

855
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,666
The purpose of this training is
to build up

856
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,361
the required amount of chakra
at a precise spot...

857
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:49,078
This is surprisingly difficult,
even for an expert ninja.

858
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,119
The amount of chakra needed
for tree climbing is very subtle.

859
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:59,006
And the soles of the feet are the
hardest part of the body to gather chakra.

860
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:03,242
In other words,
if you master the control needed for this,

861
01:03:03,793 --> 01:03:08,672
it will be possible to master
any jutsu. In theory, that is!

862
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:13,170
The second aim is to maintain
that combined chakra.

863
01:03:13,992 --> 01:03:17,078
Ninja combine the most chakra
during battles.

864
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:19,261
Under such circumstances,

865
01:03:19,286 --> 01:03:22,915
controlling and maintaining your
chakra becomes the most difficult challenge.

866
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:28,404
But anyway, just talking about it
won't accomplish anything...

867
01:03:29,313 --> 01:03:32,191
You'll need to learn it with your bodies

868
01:03:36,153 --> 01:03:38,530
Use the kunai to
mark the highest spot

869
01:03:38,706 --> 01:03:41,459
that you can climb up to
with your current strength.

870
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:47,182
Then, you'll work to make
a new mark even higher.

871
01:03:48,674 --> 01:03:51,427
You aren't good enough to
walk up from the start,

872
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:55,276
so run and use your momentum
to get used to it... Got it?

873
01:03:57,158 --> 01:04:01,403
This training is nothing!
Hah! It'll be a piece of cake!

874
01:04:02,197 --> 01:04:05,492
After all, I'm the guy
who's grown the most!

875
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:09,333
Enough with the talk...
Now get to it. Try climbing any tree.

876
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,268
<i>Ok, so first I need to gather
chakra at the bottom of my feet...</i>

877
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:27,663
Ready!! Here I go!

878
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:47,334
<i>I didn't think it'd be this difficult to
maintain a constant amount of chakra...</i>

879
01:04:47,614 --> 01:04:49,574
<i>If the chakra is too strong
you get pushed back...</i>

880
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:56,329
<i>But if it's too weak,
you'll lose your grip and fall.</i>

881
01:04:59,031 --> 01:04:59,573
<i>Well...!</i>

882
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:02,210
<i>The difference between Naruto and Sasuke
seems about right.</i>

883
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:03,957
This is pretty easy!

884
01:05:04,903 --> 01:05:05,903
What?

885
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,054
S-Sakura!

886
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,847
Wow! Way to go, Sakura!

887
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,170
Just what I'd expect from
someone as awesome as her!

888
01:05:18,235 --> 01:05:20,057
<i>But it does sort of tick me off!</i>

889
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:21,421
Whatever!

890
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,295
<i>I wanted Sasuke to notice me...</i>

891
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,797
<i>Why does this always happen?!</i>

892
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,884
Well, not only does Sakura have
knowledge about chakra,

893
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,095
her control and stamina
are pretty good.

894
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,680
It looks like...

895
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:40,312
Looks like she has the best chance of
becoming Hokage... unlike a certain someone.

896
01:05:40,759 --> 01:05:44,763
And the Uchiha Clan
doesn't seem that impressive, either.

897
01:05:45,203 --> 01:05:46,955
Shut up, Sensei!

898
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:49,817
<i>Now Sasuke's going to hate me!</i>

899
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,493
<i>Having said that...
Naruto and Sasuke...</i>

900
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,996
<i>Those two have an incredible amount
of chakra hidden in them...</i>

901
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,301
<i>that Sakura can't hope to match!</i>

902
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:05,042
<i>If this training goes well,
this will become an asset to them...</i>

903
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,631
Okay! First I'll catch up to Sasuke!

904
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,488
I'll do it... for sure!

905
01:06:15,815 --> 01:06:16,815
<i>Whatever!</i>

906
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:20,104
<i>They're just wasting their
time with that...</i>

907
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,032
Ohhhhh...

908
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:37,833
Ow!

909
01:06:46,981 --> 01:06:48,504
<i>I'm totally worn out!</i>

910
01:06:48,912 --> 01:06:51,081
<i>How much stamina
do those two have?</i>

911
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,017
<i>But Naruto isn't getting
any better at all.</i>

912
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:04,134
<i>He'll give up soon and
start throwing a tantrum.</i>

913
01:07:06,624 --> 01:07:07,208
Shoot!

914
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,154
<i>See! He sure is
an easy one to figure out!</i>

915
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:13,787
Hey, Sakura!

916
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:16,026
Can you give me some tips?

917
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,574
What?

918
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:19,867
But keep it a secret from Sasuke!
Come on, come on.

919
01:07:23,026 --> 01:07:27,531
<i>He's getting stronger and stronger...
How strong will he get?</i>

920
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,545
<i>At any rate, Naruto...</i>

921
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:34,341
<i>the amount of dormant chakra you have
is probably far more than Sasuke's.</i>

922
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,764
<i>It's probably even more than mine!</i>

923
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,184
<i>I look forward to
watching you grow... I really do.</i>

924
01:08:07,002 --> 01:08:09,602
It looks like you've got some time
to kill there, all by yourself.

925
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:14,204
What about the blond brat
and the stuck-up one?

926
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:16,755
They're in the middle of
the tree-climbing training.

927
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,010
You don't have to do that?

928
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:22,772
I mastered it quickly, so Kakashi-sensei
has me on guard duty.

929
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,558
Really?

930
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,686
<i>What?!</i>

931
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,315
Can I have a word, Tazuna?

932
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:34,128
Huh? What is it, Giichi?

933
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:36,413
Uh, actually...

934
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:38,917
I've been thinking things over...

935
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,952
Building this bridge...
I want to quit!

936
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:47,203
What? So suddenly? Not you too?!

937
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,346
Tazuna, we go back quite awhile.

938
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:54,126
I'd like to help,
but if we push it too far,

939
01:08:54,204 --> 01:08:56,540
Gato will set his sights
on us, too.

940
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,928
And... if they kill you,
it's all for nothing!

941
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,892
Why don't you just
stop building the bridge?

942
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,189
This is our bridge.

943
01:09:12,866 --> 01:09:15,786
This is the bridge that
everyone in town has built

944
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,113
believing that it will bring
distribution and transportation

945
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,448
to our land once more.

946
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,493
But we're talking about our lives...

947
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:26,757
It's already afternoon...

948
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,622
Let's call it a day.

949
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:31,791
Tazuna!

950
01:09:33,555 --> 01:09:36,433
Giichi... you don't have to
come back tomorrow.

951
01:09:43,108 --> 01:09:45,131
Damn it!

952
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:49,923
What is going on?!
Why can't I do this?!

953
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,608
<i>I won't lose to you!</i>

954
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:23,999
Say, where are we going?

955
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,616
I was asked to pick some things up
for dinner on the way home...

956
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,517
Thief!

957
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:40,387
<i>What's up with... this town?</i>

958
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:42,902
We're here...

959
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:45,036
Welcome...

960
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:57,590
<i>There's hardly anything here...</i>

961
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,553
You pervert!

962
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:12,995
Man, I was really surprised earlier.

963
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:14,956
What's going on with this town?!

964
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:17,563
<i>Again?</i>

965
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,357
Hey, you...

966
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,028
What?

967
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,030
Gimme some!

968
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,788
Oh... here...

969
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:34,956
Yaaay!

970
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,668
Thank you.

971
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,217
This is how it's been ever
since Gato showed up.

972
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:49,305
Here, all the adults
have turned into cowards.

973
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,981
That's why the bridge
is necessary...

974
01:12:00,009 --> 01:12:01,385
It's a symbol of courage...

975
01:12:02,178 --> 01:12:05,395
to restore their spirits and
stop them from giving up.

976
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,921
For the people of this land...

977
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:08,864
who have set their minds
on remaining passive...

978
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:16,415
If we can just...
complete that bridge...

979
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:21,358
This town will return to
how it once was...

980
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:24,331
and everyone will come back.

981
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,860
<i>Damn it! Damn it!</i>

982
01:12:45,155 --> 01:12:47,491
<i>Are you telling me that
Sasuke's still climbing?!</i>

983
01:12:52,462 --> 01:12:53,088
<i>Crap...</i>

984
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,953
<i>He's catching up...</i>

985
01:12:57,169 --> 01:13:00,381
<i>Damn it! No! No!</i>

986
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:04,922
<i>If I let myself get distracted by Sasuke,
my concentration will break!</i>

987
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,841
<i>Concentrate!
Concentrate!</i>

988
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,677
<i>Okay... I think I'm getting
the hang of this, y'know!</i>

989
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,763
<i>Okay! This is it!</i>

990
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,930
Hey... Naruto!

991
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,038
Jeez, what the heck's
wrong with you?!

992
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:21,205
Don't interfere while
I'm trying to concentrate!

993
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:24,786
U... Uh... Well...

994
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,236
W-What is it?!

995
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:34,858
Y-You asked Sakura to give
you some tips before...

996
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:37,201
What did she say to you?

997
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:43,188
I'm not telling!

998
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,155
Man!

999
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,682
This is really fun!

1000
01:13:56,896 --> 01:14:00,150
It's been a long time since we've had
a meal with this many people!

1001
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:07,733
Seconds please!

1002
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,742
Stop eating if you're going to vomit!

1003
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,703
No, I'll eat.

1004
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,529
I have to eat, even
if I have to force it down.

1005
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,375
I have to get strong
as quickly as possible, so...

1006
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,209
Mm-hmm.

1007
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,130
But vomiting it all back up is
just a waste.

1008
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:38,640
Excuse me, why is there
a torn picture hanging here?

1009
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,310
It's my husband...

1010
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,485
He was a man this town
once called a hero...

1011
01:14:58,406 --> 01:14:59,406
Dad!

1012
01:14:59,431 --> 01:15:02,309
I keep telling you not to
talk about him in front of Inari!

1013
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,727
Why does talking about his
father make Inari upset?

1014
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:14,570
There's a story behind that,
isn't there?

1015
01:15:16,323 --> 01:15:19,660
Inari wasn't related to that
man by blood,

1016
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,190
but they were like a real father
and son who got along really well...

1017
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:30,626
Back then, Inari was a child
who laughed all the time...

1018
01:15:32,532 --> 01:15:33,532
However...

1019
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:35,610
However...

1020
01:15:37,196 --> 01:15:42,910
Inari changed... after the
incident involving his father.

1021
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:45,332
Poochie!

1022
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,499
Poochie!

1023
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:49,941
Wrong!

1024
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,339
His name's Shooting Star...

1025
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,341
As of today, he's my dog!

1026
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:57,962
He's not Shooting Star!
He's my Poochie! Give him back!

1027
01:15:58,317 --> 01:16:00,125
Poochie's my friend!

1028
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,484
Why would we give him to a
crybaby like you?!

1029
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,351
Shut up!

1030
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,192
Poochie!

1031
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,032
That's what you get for not
handing him over quietly...

1032
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:21,718
I couldn't care less
about that dog!

1033
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,954
Hey, let him go!

1034
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,750
What have you done?!
Are you trying to kill Poochie?

1035
01:16:29,436 --> 01:16:32,439
Heh! He's your special mutt, right?

1036
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,423
Then save him, quickly.

1037
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,051
What's the matter?

1038
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,432
Is it okay with you if he dies?!

1039
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,812
- But...
- Look! He can't even dog paddle,

1040
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,089
- even though he's a dog!
- But...

1041
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:55,379
<i>I'm sorry, Poochie...
I can't swim...</i>

1042
01:16:56,386 --> 01:16:59,800
Hey! If you're his owner,
dive in after him!

1043
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,500
This is bad, Akane.
What if he can't swim?

1044
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,711
S-Save me!

1045
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,254
Leave him be.

1046
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:16,881
B-But...

1047
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:21,303
Then why don't you go save him?

1048
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,433
<i>I-I don't want to die...
Somebody save me!</i>

1049
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:28,726
P-Poochie!

1050
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,229
Poochie!

1051
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:32,978
Poochie!

1052
01:17:40,206 --> 01:17:42,166
Shooting Star escaped. Get him!

1053
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:54,967
<i>Ohhh... I can't breathe...
This... is it...</i>

1054
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,970
Are you awake, boy?

1055
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,521
I gave those kids
a good scolding.

1056
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:14,398
Here, eat!

1057
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:18,110
<i>Is this God? Oh...</i>

1058
01:18:18,684 --> 01:18:20,769
Did you... save me?

1059
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:24,616
Just eat! Start with that.

1060
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:29,371
I see. You were betrayed
by your dog, too...

1061
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:34,000
In my country, dogs are creatures
that have a keen sense of loyalty...

1062
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,587
Well, you betrayed
your dog's trust first,

1063
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,212
so there's nothing
you can do about that.

1064
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,510
I was scared and couldn't move.

1065
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,849
I wanted to save him...

1066
01:18:48,408 --> 01:18:51,077
But... I have no guts, so...

1067
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:52,477
That's right.

1068
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,815
Of course, a kid your age
would be scared.

1069
01:18:58,578 --> 01:18:59,662
But you know... boy.

1070
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,028
Just remember this.

1071
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,571
Huh?

1072
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,867
A man should live his life without regrets.

1073
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,767
For the things I truly
hold dear,

1074
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:15,161
I'll protect them to the very end
with these two arms.

1075
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,503
No matter how hard or painful it is...

1076
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,214
even if it costs me my life!

1077
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,470
We... we've got trouble, Kaiza!

1078
01:19:26,617 --> 01:19:28,786
The river dam broke
from all this rain!

1079
01:19:29,174 --> 01:19:31,629
At this rate,
District D will be flooded!

1080
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:32,517
What?!

1081
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:33,393
Dad!

1082
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,604
Inari, go out back and
get some rope!

1083
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,729
Okay!

1084
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,998
It's no use!

1085
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,103
The only thing we can do is
attach a rope and pull...

1086
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:42,780
Don't talk nonsense!
How are we going to attach a rope?!

1087
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,989
We'd die if we were to go
into such a furious current!

1088
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,034
But if we wait, everyone in
District D will be wiped out!

1089
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,452
What should we do?

1090
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,036
I'll do it.

1091
01:19:53,942 --> 01:19:54,942
Kaiza!

1092
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,750
Don't be foolish!

1093
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,752
Even you wouldn't be able to!

1094
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,544
Dad!

1095
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,047
Don't worry...

1096
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,257
Your dad's unmatched.

1097
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:08,595
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so...

1098
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,435
<i>For things I truly hold dear...</i>

1099
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:32,244
He did it!
The rope... the rope's attached!

1100
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:34,146
Okay, everybody pull!

1101
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,330
Yeah!

1102
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:40,544
From that day on... the people
of this town called Kaiza their hero.

1103
01:20:40,671 --> 01:20:44,967
And he became a father
that Inari could be proud of.

1104
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:49,970
It was around that time when Gato
set his sights on this land.

1105
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,889
And then, one night...

1106
01:21:07,123 --> 01:21:08,333
I heard...

1107
01:21:08,565 --> 01:21:11,484
That you're going to protect
this town with those arms...

1108
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,126
I dare you to try!

1109
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,190
Listen up!

1110
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:50,009
This man committed acts of violence
against the Gato Corporation,

1111
01:21:50,034 --> 01:21:52,119
and disrupted the order of
this island.

1112
01:21:53,272 --> 01:21:55,441
Therefore, he will now be executed!

1113
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:03,168
I just hope that such trivial matters
will never occur again.

1114
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:04,627
Dad!

1115
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,171
Stop, Inari...

1116
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:12,509
Do it...

1117
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:17,514
Dad...

1118
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,065
Dad!

1119
01:22:34,342 --> 01:22:37,814
Ever since then,
Inari has changed...

1120
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,853
as well as Tsunami...
and the townspeople...

1121
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:53,343
What are you doing, Naruto?

1122
01:22:53,779 --> 01:22:57,241
You've had enough training for today.
You've used too much chakra.

1123
01:22:57,803 --> 01:22:59,443
You'll die if you use
any more than that.

1124
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:01,977
I'll prove it.

1125
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,770
Prove what?

1126
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,440
I'll prove that...

1127
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,778
there are heroes...

1128
01:23:15,273 --> 01:23:16,449
in this world!

1129
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,430
Good morning!

1130
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,024
Here.

1131
01:24:32,049 --> 01:24:33,049
Thank you.

1132
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,446
Naruto didn't come back
last night?

1133
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:37,989
He's such a fool,

1134
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,200
he's been out every night,
climbing trees.

1135
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:44,621
He might be dead already
from using up too much chakra.

1136
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,207
I wonder if Naruto's okay.

1137
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,251
To think a child's out in
the middle of the night.

1138
01:24:50,865 --> 01:24:52,908
Well, you don't need to worry.

1139
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:56,007
Although he may not seem like it,
he's a full-fledged ninja.

1140
01:24:56,483 --> 01:24:57,700
I wonder...

1141
01:24:58,145 --> 01:25:02,399
That idiot's probably
all pooped out right about now.

1142
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,113
You'll catch a cold if
you keep sleeping here.

1143
01:25:23,593 --> 01:25:24,803
Who are you?

1144
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:33,795
Huh... Did you wake me up, miss?
I mean... what are you doing out here?

1145
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,620
I'm gathering medicinal herbs.

1146
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:37,585
Herbs?

1147
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:41,803
Yes. For healing injuries,
sickness and the like.

1148
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,897
You're up early, miss.

1149
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,399
You, too.

1150
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,235
What've you been doing
in a place like this so early?

1151
01:25:59,116 --> 01:26:00,295
Training!

1152
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:06,607
Could it be that...
you're a ninja or something?

1153
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:09,882
What with that headband and...

1154
01:26:10,203 --> 01:26:12,038
Is that what I look like? Is it?

1155
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,393
Yup! I'm a ninja!

1156
01:26:15,393 --> 01:26:18,896
Oh really?
That's admirable.

1157
01:26:21,512 --> 01:26:25,015
But... why are you training?

1158
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,949
I want to get stronger!

1159
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,228
But, you already look
strong enough.

1160
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,506
No, no! I want to get
even stronger!

1161
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:40,024
What for?

1162
01:26:40,615 --> 01:26:43,118
To become the greatest ninja
in my village!

1163
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:46,618
I'm going to get everyone
to recognize my strength!

1164
01:26:47,052 --> 01:26:50,472
And I have to prove something
to a certain person!

1165
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:57,529
Are you doing this for someone else?
Or are you doing it for yourself?

1166
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,630
Huh?

1167
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,593
W-What's so funny?!

1168
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:08,243
Do you have someone
precious to you?

1169
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:10,354
Precious?

1170
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,186
What are you trying to say, miss?

1171
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:17,731
<i>What is it?</i>

1172
01:27:18,211 --> 01:27:22,841
When a person has something
precious they want to protect...

1173
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,866
that's when they can truly
become strong.

1174
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:35,250
<i>If you ever lay a hand on Iruka-sensei,</i>

1175
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:37,292
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

1176
01:27:38,392 --> 01:27:41,490
Yeah! I know all about that!

1177
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:48,542
You'll get strong.

1178
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,870
Yeah!

1179
01:27:50,127 --> 01:27:53,005
I hope we meet again somewhere.

1180
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,437
Oh... and...

1181
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,066
I'm a boy!

1182
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:03,970
<i>No way!
He's even cuter than Sakura!</i>

1183
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,844
Why? That's strange.

1184
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,104
This world is full of mystery...

1185
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:32,806
Ouch.
Hey! What are you doing?!

1186
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:36,111
Did you forget to eat, you blockhead?

1187
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,318
Naruto?

1188
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:49,478
What in the world is Naruto doing?

1189
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:53,094
And Sasuke hasn't come back
from his walk either...

1190
01:29:00,658 --> 01:29:04,261
No way...
Naruto can climb that high now?

1191
01:29:05,323 --> 01:29:06,323
Wow!

1192
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:09,677
How'bout that, how'bout that?!

1193
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:12,659
I can climb this high now!

1194
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:17,617
Whoa!

1195
01:29:19,073 --> 01:29:20,073
Oh, you idiot!

1196
01:29:20,396 --> 01:29:21,192
This is bad!

1197
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,112
Gotcha!

1198
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:31,806
You fell for it, you fell for it!

1199
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:36,086
Don't scare us like that!

1200
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:39,555
<i>I'll get him for that! Cha!</i>

1201
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:42,450
<i>He's grown a little, hmm.</i>

1202
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,623
You fool.

1203
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:02,022
Sasuke...?

1204
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:05,061
Nice, Sasuke.
You're awesome!

1205
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:09,821
<i>These kids are really growing.</i>

1206
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:18,662
Naruto, huh?

1207
01:30:33,768 --> 01:30:34,888
Let's go back.

1208
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,280
Okay!

1209
01:30:41,493 --> 01:30:42,952
They're late.

1210
01:30:43,127 --> 01:30:45,337
Not just Naruto, but Sasuke too.

1211
01:30:50,814 --> 01:30:52,232
What happened to you guys?

1212
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:54,343
You're both muddy and exhausted.

1213
01:30:56,307 --> 01:30:59,519
We both... made it to the very top.

1214
01:31:00,743 --> 01:31:01,743
Good.

1215
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:07,398
Naruto, Sasuke, starting tomorrow,
you'll both be guarding Tazuna as well.

1216
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:09,885
Got it! Whoa!

1217
01:31:10,792 --> 01:31:11,793
You idiot!

1218
01:31:15,572 --> 01:31:19,075
Just a little longer,
and the bridge will be complete.

1219
01:31:19,435 --> 01:31:20,936
It's thanks to you guys.

1220
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:23,397
Even so, don't let your guard down...

1221
01:31:24,809 --> 01:31:27,896
I've really wanted to ask
you for a long time now...

1222
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:33,566
But why are you still here
even though I lied about the mission?

1223
01:31:36,398 --> 01:31:39,360
To abandon a just cause
is the mark of a coward.

1224
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,900
It's an old saying I happen to like.

1225
01:31:59,369 --> 01:32:02,206
Why are you pushing yourself so hard
that you're about to collapse?!

1226
01:32:02,292 --> 01:32:05,921
There's no way you'll be a match for
Gato's men, no matter how hard you train!

1227
01:32:06,303 --> 01:32:10,307
Shut up. I'm not like you.

1228
01:32:10,332 --> 01:32:13,377
Shut up!
Just looking at you makes me sick!

1229
01:32:13,803 --> 01:32:16,973
Stop sticking your nose in our business!
You don't know anything about this land!

1230
01:32:17,451 --> 01:32:19,619
I'm not like you—always
acting so carefree and oblivious,

1231
01:32:19,644 --> 01:32:22,236
someone who doesn't know
what it's like to truly suffer!

1232
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:28,882
An idiot like you can cry all you want!
You crybaby!

1233
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:32,780
Naruto! That's too harsh!

1234
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:38,485
Naruto...

1235
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:55,110
Got a minute?

1236
01:33:03,463 --> 01:33:06,508
Naruto didn't mean any harm
with what he said...

1237
01:33:08,058 --> 01:33:10,019
He's just uncouth, so...

1238
01:33:11,478 --> 01:33:14,940
We heard the story
about your father from Tazuna.

1239
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:20,596
Like you, Naruto also grew up
without a father...

1240
01:33:21,994 --> 01:33:24,455
In fact, he never knew either
of his parents.

1241
01:33:25,144 --> 01:33:27,981
Not only that.
He didn't have a single friend.

1242
01:33:28,308 --> 01:33:29,308
What?

1243
01:33:29,732 --> 01:33:30,732
However...

1244
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,443
I've never once seen him
complain or cry.

1245
01:33:36,103 --> 01:33:41,442
He's always trying so hard,
just wanting to be acknowledged.

1246
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,851
He always puts his life on the line
for that dream.

1247
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:52,609
He's probably tired of crying.

1248
01:33:54,819 --> 01:33:58,906
That's why Naruto understands
how you feel, probably more than anyone.

1249
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,595
What Naruto said earlier...

1250
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:08,560
I'm sure it's something he's been
telling himself over and over again.

1251
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:24,533
You've recovered considerably.

1252
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:26,391
All right...

1253
01:34:26,975 --> 01:34:28,810
Just a little more, Haku.

1254
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:30,622
Yes.
