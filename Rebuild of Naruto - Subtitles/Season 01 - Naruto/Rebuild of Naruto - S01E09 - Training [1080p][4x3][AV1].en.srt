1
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:32,165
To everyone who has advanced to
the Final Round

2
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,126
of the third test of the Chunin Exam,

3
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:38,408
Though one person is missing,
congratulations.

4
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,267
Sensei...

5
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,351
Hmm?

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,313
I have a question.

7
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,672
About Sasuke?

8
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,859
Unfortunately, I don't know much.

9
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,406
But don't worry too much.

10
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>From here on out, it's all up to Sasuke.</i>

11
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,875
Sakura, I have to step out
for a moment.

12
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,132
Get the details on the Final Round for me!

13
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,267
Sure.

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,802
<i>Including the one who's absent, Sasuke,</i>

15
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>we have five Leaf,</i>

16
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,766
<i>three Sand,</i>

17
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,894
<i>and one Sound.</i>

18
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,604
Well then,
I will now explain the Final Round.

19
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,904
<i>Finally!</i>

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,240
The preliminary matches
have ended without incident.

21
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
It seems they're moving on
to the Final Round.

22
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,960
This land really has become
peaceful, hasn't it?

23
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,421
This era of peace has made
this land complacent...

24
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:57,218
while all the others are busy racing
to expand their military.

25
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,942
Perhaps we could take it now?

26
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,975
Hmph, I suppose.

27
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,730
Though, I don't know how much fun
it would be to take out that old man.

28
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:13,754
You still show signs of hesitation.

29
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,738
From now on, the power of
each Hidden Village will clash

30
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,793
in a long and violent conflict
with one another.

31
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,159
The Sound Village is also be one of them...

32
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,966
You intend to be the trigger
for all of that...

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,960
And use him as the bullet.

34
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:35,203
Sasuke... is it?

35
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,843
A good guess.

36
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,536
So well that it's a bit unsettling.

37
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,431
The Curse Mark that was given to him...

38
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,601
appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.

39
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,230
Though, that won't matter much.

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,483
While there is still some
darkness left in his heart...

41
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,152
I want you to bring him to me.

42
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,323
That's an uncharacteristically
hasty request, isn't it?

43
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,993
There's a little something troubling me...

44
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,653
Is it Naruto Uzumaki?

45
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,267
According to your information,

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:17,715
his interactions with the Nine-Tails kid
have altered Sasuke's heart.

47
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,138
So much so, that he possesses
some influence over Sasuke.

48
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,391
The best thing to do is to get Sasuke
away from him immediately...

49
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,980
And quickly mold him to my will.

50
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,822
Well, then...

51
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,159
<i>That face...</i>

52
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,702
<i>I wonder what could possibly
be going on in his head?</i>

53
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:50,541
The Final Round is where
each one of you

54
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,902
will show off your battle skills
in front of everyone.

55
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,212
I want you to fully demonstrate
and show off your ability

56
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:59,615
as shinobi representing
your respective lands.

57
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,928
Accordingly, the Final Round will
commence one month from now.

58
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,848
W-We're not going to
do it here, right now?

59
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,435
This is so that there's
a suitable period of preparation.

60
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,395
What do you mean?

61
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,314
That is to say...

62
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:17,041
Along with the announcement of
the conclusion

63
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,827
of the preliminary matches to each
country's Daimyo and shinobi leaders,

64
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,648
readying the summons for the
Final Round requires preparation time...

65
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:29,245
not to mention the time for you,
the examinees, to prepare.

66
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,582
<i>This old man always has such
a roundabout way of saying things.</i>

67
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,084
I don't quite get what
you're trying to say.

68
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,598
What do you mean?

69
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,213
In other words,
in order to know your adversary,

70
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,240
in order to prepare yourself,
time is necessary.

71
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,570
Time to analyze what you learned
about your opponents in the preliminaries...

72
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,096
and time to reflect on your own performance.

73
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:50,071
The battles until now were
like actual battles.

74
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:54,708
They simulated situations where
you didn't know your opponent.

75
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:56,573
<i>That's for sure...</i>

76
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:00,063
<i>I never dreamed that this guy
could make sand into a weapon.</i>

77
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:03,379
However, this is not the case
in the Final Round.

78
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,951
Some of you may have already
shown all your cards to your rivals...

79
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,246
In the spirit of fairness and equality,

80
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,751
you will have a month to
train yourself to further your skills.

81
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:32,308
<i>Now, I can't be thinking of this</i>

82
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,977
<i>as a month-long vacation
to just slack off, y'know!</i>

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,230
<i>Seriously! Seriously!</i>

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,324
Perhaps it wasn't wise
to stand out so much.

85
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:53,579
We failed to stay out of Orochimaru's
watchful eye,

86
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,322
and it was unfortunate for us both.

87
00:06:56,332 --> 00:07:00,002
<i>Under this gentle exterior,
a seed of evil took root-</i>

88
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
<i>and it was this seed that was exploited...</i>

89
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,632
<i>Some day, through that ninjutsu...</i>

90
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:06,723
<i>this child will as well...</i>

91
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,151
I have to give it to you, Kakashi...

92
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,612
Stopping my attack from your blind spot...

93
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:32,660
But, you'd better have at least
10 operatives ready next time.

94
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,667
The ANBU that I prepared were
taken out without difficulty...

95
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,379
You're not an ordinary Genin, are you?

96
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,633
You caught a whiff of me and immediately
readied your weapon...

97
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,135
you're quite impressive.

98
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
No, I'm not all that.

99
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,848
What do you want with Sasuke?

100
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,018
Depending on the circumstances,
I'll take you in for questioning.

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,023
I wonder if someone at your level
is capable of that.

102
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,459
Are you looking to take me on?

103
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:13,364
You are the son of the chief of the
Leaf medical corps, aren't you?

104
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,997
You're Kabuto Yakushi, aren't you?

105
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,583
Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?

106
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,336
If you arrest me here now,

107
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,839
you might never be able to prove
my connection to Orochimaru.

108
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,759
Shut up and answer my questions.

109
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,802
And if I say no?

110
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,889
I'm the one asking the
questions around here.

111
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,633
Now give me some answers.

112
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,852
You'll find out soon enough
if you just let me go.

113
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,231
So, could you make an exception
just this once?

114
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,609
You impudent brat...

115
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,864
Don't mess with adults.

116
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,407
Don't be so arrogant.

117
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,702
The circumstances are in my favor...

118
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,683
<i>A Shadow Clone!</i>

119
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>Damn... I've let him escape.</i>

120
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,462
<i>Impressive...</i>

121
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
<i>As I suspected...</i>

122
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,093
<i>This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,</i>

123
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,096
<i>where one temporarily reanimates
a corpse by controlling its heart.</i>

124
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>Meticulously transforming even the face...</i>

125
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>He even stopped his own heartbeat
and eliminated any trace of his scent...</i>

126
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,901
<i>all to set up his escape by
impersonating a murdered ANBU member...</i>

127
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>He's the adopted son of the
Medical Corps Captain for a reason.</i>

128
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,910
<i>If someone this good is working
for Orochimaru...</i>

129
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,205
<i>I can't afford to stay
at my current level...</i>

130
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:26,937
Now that that's done...

131
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,212
I'd like to dismiss you all now...

132
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,757
But first, for the Final Round,

133
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:36,119
there is one more important
matter to take care of.

134
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:40,575
Let's get on with it,
so we can get to training

135
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,769
Now, now. I want you all to
calmly take one slip of paper

136
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:47,255
from the box that Anko is holding.

137
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,902
I'm going to go around in order...
take only one.

138
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,371
Good, everyone has taken
a number.

139
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,249
Then, from left to right, tell me
the number on your slip of paper.

140
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,833
I'm eight.

141
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,010
I'm one.

142
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,545
Seven.

143
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Five.

144
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:14,805
Three.

145
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:15,966
Nine.

146
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:16,779
Two.

147
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,917
Six.

148
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,013
In other words, he must be number four.

149
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,639
Uh huh.

150
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,134
Very well, I will tell you

151
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:28,208
about how the Final Round
tournament will work!

152
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,564
Huh?

153
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,566
So that's what drawing lots was for?

154
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,903
Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.

155
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,112
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,830
<i>He's so far away.</i>

157
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,291
<i>Is that all the Final Round is,
a tournament?</i>

158
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:52,034
<i>Man! I have one extra round.</i>

159
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:55,724
<i>Vendetta for Choji?
Give me a break!</i>

160
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,437
<i>I'm so relieved I'm not in
the same bracket as Gaara.</i>

161
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,430
<i>Sasuke Uchiha...</i>

162
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,557
<i>Perfect.</i>

163
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,594
<i>Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?</i>

164
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,772
<i>This couldn't be better!
Believe it!</i>

165
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,233
Could I ask a question?

166
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,567
Go ahead.

167
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,864
Does this mean that there will
only be one winner of the tournament?

168
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,493
That only one of us will be
able to become a Chunin?

169
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,871
No, on the contrary.

170
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:30,680
The judges of the Final Round,
of which I am one,

171
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:32,040
will be made up of the Kazekage,

172
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,860
the Daimyo from various countries
who will assign you your missions,

173
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:37,888
and the shinobi leaders.

174
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,050
Through this tournament,

175
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,405
these judges will be able to make
a thorough evaluation,

176
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,466
and come to a decision as to
whether each of you

177
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:49,327
possesses the qualities required
of a Chunin.

178
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:54,402
Even if someone loses the first round,
they can still become a Chunin.

179
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:59,547
So there's a chance that all
of us will become Chunin?

180
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:04,647
Correct, but conversely, there's also
a chance that none of you will.

181
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,828
To "advance" in the tournament,

182
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,583
means more opportunities
to impress the judges.

183
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:15,657
Understood, Shikamaru?

184
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,799
<i>This is all a real pain in my...</i>

185
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,459
Thank you for your patience.

186
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,611
We will adjourn until next month.

187
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,177
<i>So, my second match is against either
the Sand's 'No Eyebrows' or Sasuke?</i>

188
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,852
<i>That guy is so strong he kicked
Bushy Brow's butt.</i>

189
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,589
<i>I want to fight you, too.</i>

190
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,761
<i>Now that it's come to this,
I've got to find Kakashi-sensei.</i>

191
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,491
Lady Hanabi! Terrible news!

192
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,462
I heard my sister Hinata
was seriously injured!

193
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,924
She's been treated and
is conscious now.

194
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:03,640
There's no need to worry.

195
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,561
She should have expected
this outcome if she faced Neji.

196
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,313
Why didn't you withdraw?

197
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,192
I couldn't... do that.

198
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,545
I know very well what I am.

199
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm an indecisive failure...

200
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,788
But I don't want to give up,
I want to become strong...

201
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,033
I feel like I can possibly change.

202
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,794
Watching Naruto makes me
feel this way.

203
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,168
<i>Naruto...</i>

204
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:44,133
<i>What are you doing here?
You're a curse on all of us!</i>

205
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,328
<i>What? I was only...</i>

206
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,805
<i>I was only looking at the masks!</i>

207
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,889
I never go back on my word.

208
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:59,842
Because that's my Ninja Way.

209
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,355
Umm, where's the room
that Sasuke's in?

210
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,799
I'm sorry. Sasuke
is not allowed visitors.

211
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,327
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that, y'know?!

212
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm sorry, those are the rules.

213
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,413
Hey miss, tell me why?

214
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:17,191
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.

215
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,596
Kakashi-sensei!

216
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,466
Hey! Hey!

217
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
I've got a favor to ask!

218
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,882
You don't need to say it all.

219
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,273
Well, I figured this might happen, so...

220
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,594
I searched for someone
to oversee your training.

221
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,183
Why?! I want you to, Kakashi-sensei!

222
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,602
I have some matters to take care of.

223
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,979
I don't have time to look after you.

224
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
Oh! Aaaah...!

225
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,818
You're going to train Sasuke, aren't you!

226
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,445
Well, don't say that.

227
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,282
I found a sensei who's
more reliable than I am!

228
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,201
Well... who is it?

229
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,109
It's me!

230
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,328
Huh?!

231
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,210
Oh!

232
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,098
You!

233
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,875
The Closet Perv!

234
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,126
Such insolence!

235
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,837
What did you say?

236
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,006
But you see! But you see!

237
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:08,908
A while back, this guy totally fell
for my Harem Jutsu...

238
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,221
Harem Jutsu?

239
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:14,832
U-Uh... it's nothing!

240
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,404
I'll treat you to anything
you want later!

241
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:22,949
Just be quiet about that!

242
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,274
You better.

243
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,487
Wow, I didn't know you
were acquainted.

244
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
It's not exactly a fond memory, though.

245
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,327
But why this guy?

246
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,830
I definitely don't want him to.

247
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,313
Same here.

248
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:42,943
If Kakashi hadn't asked me, I wouldn't
waste my time teaching the likes of you.

249
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,114
Then don't.

250
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,625
Now, now, both of you...

251
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,214
Don't say that.

252
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,260
Naruto, Ebisu-sensei is a private tutor

253
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,097
who teaches the elite,
a special Jonin!

254
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,684
He's truly better
at teaching than I am.

255
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,650
Well, Naruto, of the three kids
in Team 7 that I taught,

256
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,260
you're the worst at the basic skills.

257
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,697
So make sure you get your
fundamentals down this time.

258
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,785
How am I any worse than
Sakura and Sasuke?!

259
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,959
Naruto, it's fact that you
don't have the fundamentals down.

260
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:27,369
No matter what you do,
the basic skills are important.

261
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:32,178
If you really want to become strong,
just be quiet and listen to what I say.

262
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,724
Now then, Ebisu-sensei,
I'm leaving him with you.

263
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,267
Yes, yes.

264
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,101
<i>Damn it.</i>

265
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>It may appear to be harsh,</i>

266
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,775
<i>but you have the potential
to become much stronger.</i>

267
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,611
<i>Do your best.</i>

268
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,823
Okay, then, let's go.

269
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:10,862
Watch out!

270
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,829
Hey Choji!

271
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,148
You make it sound like Shikamaru
is your only opponent!

272
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,586
But it's gonna hurt, you know.

273
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:24,115
I'm strong and I don't
wanna hurt you two.

274
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,617
What makes you think
you're better?

275
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,514
Go ahead, try and hurt us!

276
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,810
C'mon! Cry! Scream!

277
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,730
Stop! You're hurting me!

278
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:38,573
Damn it... What a drag.

279
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:42,545
Choji, are you being gentle
because they're your friends?

280
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,366
Asuma-sensei...

281
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,290
If that's the case, you're wrong.

282
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,380
Sparring with a stronger partner
will only help

283
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,828
to make them stronger too.

284
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:57,752
You don't get it?

285
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:00,242
Then I'll show you.

286
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:04,623
We're going to spar right now.

287
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,887
If you're able to strike me, you pass.

288
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:13,527
But if you're not able to hit me
within one hour, Choji...

289
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,078
Not just you,

290
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,532
but Ino and Shikamaru will be
sent back to the Academy.

291
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,841
Huh? No fair!

292
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,696
Think of me as the enemy and charge,
for their sake too.

293
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,459
Transform your kindness into power.

294
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,366
One miso chashu and one shio ramen!

295
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,592
Here you go!

296
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,431
Naruto, having been shown
your movements and

297
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:45,827
having further analyzed
what Kakashi has told me...

298
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,980
it's clear that you have
poor chakra control.

299
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,774
Control...?

300
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,108
That's right.

301
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,946
Now then, comparing you
with Sasuke and Sakura...

302
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,700
I shall explain your
weak points in order.

303
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:06,455
As you know, in the case of using
ninjutsu, genjutsu and the like,

304
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,708
ninja build up chakra and
activate the jutsu.

305
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,544
I-I know that already!

306
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,529
Is that so?

307
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,175
Then, in the case of comparing
the three of you,

308
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,870
I shall explain specifically
how you are inferior.

309
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,890
That's kind of an irritating
way of saying it.

310
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,935
I'm treating you the ramen
as promised,

311
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,186
so be quiet and listen!

312
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,191
First, let us say that Sakura
uses Clone Jutsu.

313
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

314
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,576
In her case, her ability to both
mold and control her chakra is perfect,

315
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,496
so she can make clones without
using wasteful energy.

316
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,665
Cha!

317
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,417
Next, in Sasuke's case,

318
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,837
he is somewhat poor at
building up chakra.

319
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,590
<i>Clone Jutsu.</i>

320
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,223
But, his control of chakra is perfect,

321
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,602
so both he and Sakura can
make five clones.

322
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:16,149
But, he uses a bit more chakra
than Sakura.

323
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,526
Oh!

324
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,695
So Sasuke's nothing special.

325
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:23,891
In your case, there's no time
to be laughing at others.

326
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,241
Huh?

327
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,206
You're very poor at both
molding and controlling your chakra,

328
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,152
so you cannot make clones
with the same amount of chakra.

329
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,209
In the case where you strain to
make clones despite that,

330
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,772
after consuming a much larger amount
of chakra than Sakura and Sasuke...

331
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,386
<i>Clone Jutsu!</i>

332
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:49,791
... you can barely make
one clone at best.

333
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:51,681
By the way,

334
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:56,517
Sakura and Sasuke can make ten clones
with the same amount of chakra.

335
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,486
But, there've been times when
I was greater than Sakura and Sasuke...

336
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:02,863
That's only because you
happen to have

337
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,805
the most outstanding stamina
of the three!

338
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,666
Anyway, there is no mistaking
that you can become strong

339
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:17,255
if you carry out the training
we will be doing from now.

340
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,795
Huh?! Really?!

341
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:21,241
I guarantee it.

342
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,258
Now then, let's go.

343
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,342
Sir, your bill.

344
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,137
Oh, that's right.

345
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,471
Wha?!

346
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,468
Thank you very much!

347
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,867
We've come quite a long way...

348
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,328
But, this is a hot spring town, right?

349
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,123
We're not just here for a relaxing
soak in the hot springs, are we?

350
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,959
Hey! Naruto!

351
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,419
That's the women's bath!

352
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,823
I simply will not allow
indecent behavior!

353
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,928
What's with that look?

354
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,513
N-Nothing.

355
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,766
More importantly, why've we come
to a place like this?!

356
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,435
Will soaking in a hot spring
do anything for training?

357
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,812
No!

358
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,115
The training will be here
in this hot spring area!

359
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,404
Okay, this is the place.

360
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,075
It's a bath, sure enough!

361
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,075
What are you saying?

362
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:32,785
I said this is training, didn't I?
Training!

363
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,664
We're going to train here?

364
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,416
What the heck are we going to do?

365
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,013
Walk on this hot water!

366
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,268
What?!

367
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,790
What is it?

368
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,430
Walk on hot water?

369
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,599
Can you really do that?

370
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,147
Of course!

371
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,808
I heard from Kakashi-sensei.

372
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:03,864
You already did tree climbing training
without using your hands, right?

373
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:05,640
It's an application of that.

374
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,821
Hmm...
What do you mean?

375
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,658
Besides, I don't really remember
stuff from long ago.

376
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,752
In tree climbing, all you do
is accumulate

377
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:17,305
just the right amount of chakra
to a specific spot

378
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,875
and maintain that amount of
chakra all the while.

379
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:23,650
Trees are fixed objects,
so you only need to be attached to it.

380
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:26,287
In other words,

381
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:29,775
it's training for building up
a fixed amount of chakra.

382
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,013
To float on the surface of water,

383
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:34,303
you have to constantly release

384
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,689
a precise amount of chakra
from the soles of your feet

385
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:40,635
to generate enough force
to support your body weight.

386
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,022
Huh?

387
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,443
This chakra control is
more difficult than maintaining...

388
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,906
It's an exercise in controlling
the release and use of a constant amount

389
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,991
of chakra for jutsu and the like.

390
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,994
Hmm, I really don't get it!

391
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,498
Well, it would be better to
show you in your case.

392
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,542
First, you build up chakra
in your feet.

393
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:07,893
Then, while constantly discharging
a fixed amount...

394
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:10,318
you balance it with your body weight.

395
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,526
And...

396
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,303
well, this is how it goes.

397
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,645
Oh! Okay!
I'm going to try!

398
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,980
First, you build up chakra
in your feet.

399
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,274
Then!

400
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,377
Discharge a fixed amount. Right?

401
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,403
Oh!

402
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,904
I knew it.

403
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:33,886
Hot-hot-hot-hot!

404
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,452
I forgot to mention it,
but this hot water is 60º C.

405
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,606
If you do nothing but fail...

406
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:41,906
you will become a boiled octopus!

407
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,288
Damn it!

408
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,670
<i>I'll do it no matter what!</i>

409
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:06,639
<i>You're unusually spirited today,
Honorable Grandson!</i>

410
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:12,199
<i>My teachings are finally
getting through to him!</i>

411
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,367
<i>This would ordinarily be the
time to go carry out</i>

412
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:17,269
<i>a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.</i>

413
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,891
<i>I've stopped doing that now!</i>

414
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:21,436
<i>That's right!</i>

415
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,682
<i>So you have finally understood.</i>

416
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:28,169
<i>That the shortcut to become
Hokage is to do as I say...</i>

417
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,628
<i>There are no shortcuts!</i>

418
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,506
<i>Huh?</i>

419
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,093
<i>Naruto said it...</i>

420
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,890
<i>If you're to become Hokage,
be prepared for that!</i>

421
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,562
Oh!

422
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,654
I'm starting to get it!

423
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,615
<i>To think he would get the
hang of the chakra control this quickly...</i>

424
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,976
<i>I never thought
you would grow this much.</i>

425
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:04,355
<i>Indeed, there are no shortcuts,
in anything...</i>

426
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,126
<i>It appears I had the
wrong idea about you...</i>

427
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,630
<i>You are a much smarter teacher
than I am.</i>

428
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,924
<i>And, you are not just a Demon Fox...</i>

429
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,180
<i>You are a splendid ninja
of the Hidden Leaf Village.</i>

430
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,350
Oh! Hot!

431
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,976
Hm?! That is!

432
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,694
Humph! I don't know who you are
or where you're from, but...

433
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,782
I will not allow indecency!

434
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,158
Man...

435
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,579
T-That is!

436
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,581
What?!

437
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,428
Don't make a ruckus.

438
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:04,038
Jeez, it won't do to be found out!

439
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,664
<i>The Closet Perv lost?</i>

440
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,528
<i>Wh-What's with that
Shameless Perv?!</i>

441
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:27,133
Hey... Closet pervert.

442
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>Taijutsu Secret Technique:</i>

443
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,748
<i>A Thousand Years of Death!</i>

444
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:42,637
He's out cold... Just as I thought,
he's weak.

445
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,560
What's with that big frog?
What the heck are you?

446
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,482
Thank you for asking me!

447
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,486
I am the great Toad Sage
from Mount Myoboku, the immortal...

448
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,740
also known as the Toad Mountain Sage.

449
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,910
M-Mountain Sage?

450
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,244
Exactly.

451
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,880
Hey... Pervy Sage,
what are you going to do about this?

452
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,340
He was supposed to be supervising
my training.

453
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,676
You did that to him.

454
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,138
He interfered with my research.

455
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,389
Research?

456
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,643
I'm a writer.
I'm writing a novel.

457
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,102
This is it.

458
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,781
Oh, that is...!

459
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,824
You know this?

460
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>I've gotten quite famous.</i>

461
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,456
That's not much of a novel!

462
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,156
In the first place,
what research are you talking about?

463
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,461
You're just peeking at the girls' bath!

464
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,670
- Yikes!
- No!

465
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,301
Idiot, idiot... idiot!
They found me out!

466
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,886
You pervert.

467
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,515
F-Fool! I'm not just a pervert.

468
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:13,144
This peeking is research! It's how
I get inspiration for my masterpieces!

469
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
Liar! No excuses.

470
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,983
More importantly, what are you
going to do about my training?

471
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,280
You mean the walking on water technique
you were doing earlier?

472
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,573
You know it?

473
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,953
Then take responsibility
and join my training.

474
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:32,895
Hmph. I don't care about such things.

475
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,168
Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!

476
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,088
Join my training, hey!

477
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,885
Shut up! I hate disrespectful little brats...

478
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,138
And I don't like men.

479
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,933
Oh, umm, umm...

480
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:57,163
I heard that Make-Out Paradise book
is super exciting and cool!

481
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,651
You have to be over 18
to even buy that book.

482
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:02,718
You liar.

483
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:05,713
The reviews that I've heard are great.

484
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,033
Flattery will get you nowhere.
I'm a sage!

485
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,538
I'm not so foolish as to be swayed
by a pipsqueak like you.

486
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,959
Oh, hey... wait!

487
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,631
Farewell, kid.

488
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:30,026
Wow! He's cool even
though he's a pervert.

489
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,564
Fight, Choji, you coward!

490
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,822
That's not the way.
It'll only backfire.

491
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51,177
It's not because Choji's scared.

492
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:56,331
He doesn't want to hurt Asuma-sensei
the way he's hurting now.

493
00:31:57,484 --> 00:32:00,528
He's very kind,
down to his very core.

494
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,629
But as it is...

495
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,715
We have no choice.

496
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,178
Hey, Choji! Enough already,
you fatso!

497
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,223
Shikamaru...

498
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:17,183
Did you just say "fatso"?

499
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:20,498
Yeah... I said "fatso."

500
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,024
That's what Asuma-sensei said...

501
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:27,817
Really... Sensei?

502
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:30,030
Y-Yeah...

503
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:35,896
Yes! He said that a fatso like you
wouldn't be able to punch him!

504
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,882
You're going overboard, Ino.

505
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,631
I don't care if you're my Sensei.

506
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,099
Anyone who calls me "fatso"
is gonna pay!

507
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,296
I'm sorry...

508
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:02,468
I can't hit you after all, Sensei.

509
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:10,380
But... but, please just send me
back to the Academy.

510
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:13,728
Please don't punish Shikamaru and Ino.

511
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,333
I understand, Choji.

512
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,045
It's my loss.

513
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,687
No matter how angry you are,

514
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:32,568
you were able to suppress that anger
and think of your opponent.

515
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,024
You have true kindness within you.

516
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,599
I want you to continue
nurturing that kindness.

517
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:41,956
Someday, it will become your strength.

518
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:46,100
But you know,
when you are sparring...

519
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,498
I know!

520
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,285
I don't want to beat people
like you or Shikamaru

521
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,312
or Ino or my friends from the village.

522
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,205
But if I'm up against anyone
who hurts them, I'll fight them.

523
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:05,585
Even if Shikamaru and Ino
keep calling me "fatso."

524
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:15,203
By the way, Shikamaru and Ino,
Choji isn't fat.

525
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:18,139
He's just big-boned.

526
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:31,894
I want to have a romantic encounter
with a well-stacked girl.

527
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,991
How dare you do that to me earlier!

528
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,120
Substitution Jutsu.

529
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,665
Just as I thought.
He's no ordinary old man.

530
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,592
Hmph! That punk...

531
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,971
It'll be a million years before
that kid is ready to take me on.

532
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,933
Not really.

533
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,481
It seems you have a bit of talent.

534
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,956
Then you'll supervise my training?

535
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:12,482
It's a give and take!

536
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,813
I don't mind helping you out...

537
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:19,394
as long as you're willing
to do the same for me.

538
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:20,628
So what do you want?

539
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,870
Listen up...

540
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:28,626
Some 'nice, ripe fruit' that's curvy
like this, and this, and this.

541
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,588
I'll supervise your training
if you bring me that.

542
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:33,949
You really will, right?

543
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,259
This Toad Mountain Sage doesn't lie.

544
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,203
Okay, wait!

545
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,651
Plans are plans.
They don't necessarily have to happen...

546
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:57,554
Hello there, you ladies!

547
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:05,295
Oh my... You're funny, old man.

548
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:09,250
No, no, this is the solemn truth.

549
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,669
Yeah? And then what happened?

550
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,046
Hey, Pervy Sage!

551
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,583
Oh no! He called him Pervy Sage.

552
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:20,845
You fool! Who's a Pervy Sage?

553
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,194
I brought the promised item.

554
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,575
Nice ripe fruit...

555
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,814
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!
This isn't what I meant!

556
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,779
I'm full...

557
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,490
Ladies...

558
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,787
<i>No doubt about it. That's...</i>

559
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:53,461
Good grief. I've wasted time...

560
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:59,300
Hold it! Where are you going?!
What about my training?!

561
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,971
I don't care! My precious research
has been ruined thanks to you.

562
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:10,603
Research, my butt!
I can't be standing around here, either!

563
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:13,623
I'm going to train hard,
become stronger than anybody,

564
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,483
pass the Chunin Exam,

565
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,110
and then I'm gonna surpass all the Hokage!

566
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,115
Hmph! I don't care about such things.

567
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,284
Here all you do is get in my way...

568
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,245
Jeez, what an annoying brat!

569
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,931
Stacked girls like the ones
from earlier

570
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:34,293
are indispensable for
my literary masterpiece!

571
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:38,744
I see... So I should bring
some stacked girls, right?

572
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,173
Okay.

573
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,375
W-Wow...!

574
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,337
If you gaze at me like that...
I feel embarrassed.

575
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,383
Oh...!

576
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:29,015
Wow, you're just my type!
What do you call that jutsu?

577
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,601
It's called Sexy Jutsu.

578
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:37,527
Oooh, what an idea. You're a genius.

579
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,694
<i>I get the feeling all adults are
really affected by this technique.</i>

580
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,613
Then you'll watch my training?

581
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,295
A-Always be... in that form
when you're in front of me!

582
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,552
Hey! So you really are just a plain
old pervert! You Pervy Sage!

583
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,388
No! I'm not just a pervert!

584
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,831
Don't play dumb!

585
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,812
I'm a super pervert!

586
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,816
Damn it... Now he's proud of it.

587
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,531
Alright, let's just write off
everything up to now as a joke.

588
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,024
I'll supervise your training.

589
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:31,231
You mean it, right?

590
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,888
A sage doesn't go back on his word.

591
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,912
Okay, kid.

592
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,917
Show me that training exercise
you were doing before.

593
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,752
Okay!

594
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,965
Okay.

595
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,568
Totally worthless.

596
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,736
Shut up!

597
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,072
It's pointless to wear clothes.

598
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,617
Hey, mold your chakra one more time.

599
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,366
One more time?

600
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:14,683
Just do it quickly.

601
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:37,268
<i>I see...
So this is the sealing formula.</i>

602
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:42,231
<i>Two Four-Symbols Seals making up
an Eight Trigrams Seal...</i>

603
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,275
<i>So it's an Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.</i>

604
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,112
<i>The Nine-Tails' chakra is leaking out
from between the seals...</i>

605
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,282
<i>and is mixing with
the kid's own chakra.</i>

606
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,996
<i>But after that, it's stopped
with a Five Pronged Seal...</i>

607
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,458
<i>Placing an odd-numbered seal
on top of an even-numbered one...</i>

608
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:04,842
<i>The kid's own chakra and that of
the Nine-Tails are unevenly intermingled,</i>

609
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:06,285
<i>and are not stable.</i>

610
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,135
<i>No wonder he can't mold chakra properly.</i>

611
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,475
That tickles... old man.

612
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,977
Oh, sorry, sorry.

613
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,522
<i>Perhaps someone else... did it...</i>

614
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,316
<i>The handiwork is sloppy.</i>

615
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,986
<i>Well, it was probably Orochimaru.</i>

616
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,662
Kid, let out a yell for me.

617
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,497
What?

618
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,666
Just a shout... Like "banzai!"

619
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,420
<i>Five-Pronged Seal: Release!</i>

620
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,351
What are you doing?!

621
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,271
Well, I just hit some pressure points
to help you relax.

622
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:08,190
Just try walking on
the water once more...

623
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,902
Sheesh!

624
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,868
What?

625
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,630
I don't know why, but it's going well!

626
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,049
Yahoo!

627
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:40,418
<i>I guess it's about time to teach him
how to control the Nine-Tails' chakra.</i>

628
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,601
Okay, kid. Come on out.

629
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,397
I'll teach you my trump card technique.

630
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,067
A trump card technique?
A killer move?

631
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,500
There's something you need to
understand well

632
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,579
before I teach you techniques.

633
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:06,753
You probably haven't noticed,
but you possess two types of chakra.

634
00:43:07,044 --> 00:43:08,837
Huh? Two types?

635
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,506
Until now, have you ever
felt a special chakra?

636
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,385
Special? Hmm...

637
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,930
Come to think of it...

638
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:24,529
Come to think of it,
I get the feeling there were times when...

639
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:30,088
my chakra would suddenly surge
and this incredible power would burst out.

640
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:34,878
But...
I don't really remember those moments.

641
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:36,692
I see.

642
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,827
But I do remember sensing that
it was different

643
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:41,188
from the chakra I always build up.

644
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,579
If I liken it to colors,

645
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,230
while it's normally blue...

646
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,294
the other felt like
it was red or something.

647
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,257
Okay. That's it for today's training.

648
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,842
What?! Already?

649
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,636
What happened to the ace technique?

650
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,429
I can still train.

651
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,935
You know what they say,
all work and no play...

652
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,061
As long as we're here,
let's take a bath...

653
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,854
Not just falling in...

654
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,330
Warms me up.

655
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,263
A drink after training's the best.

656
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,712
Hey, hey, Pervy Sage.

657
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:35,827
What kind of technique is
that ace technique?

658
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,716
You'll find out tomorrow.

659
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,426
Stingy!

660
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,236
We'll turn into boiled frogs if
we stay in here too long.

661
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,128
Ebisu, sorry for poaching
your student.

662
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:17,664
It's okay. More importantly,
I was surprised...

663
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,218
The Hokage has had us searching
all over for you

664
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,762
and we could never determine
your whereabouts.

665
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:26,713
To think you were in this village...

666
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,851
The Hokage will be pleased.

667
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,980
Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?

668
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,023
Not yet.

669
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:38,266
I see. That's for the best.

670
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,529
So, it's about Orochimaru?

671
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,615
No, unfortunately not.

672
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,866
What?

673
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:49,135
I just stopped by looking
for material for my novel...

674
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:52,673
It's not in my nature
to go looking for trouble.

675
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,712
What are you saying?!
You should know!

676
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,215
The only way to stop Orochimaru,

677
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:01,859
one of the legendary three Sannin,

678
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:04,358
is the power of another Sannin!

679
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:06,997
Your power, Master Jiraiya!

680
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:32,495
You don't sleep at all?

681
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,861
What do you want?

682
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,963
I thought I'd crush you now.

683
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:44,327
I know your Sand attack.

684
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,139
I wonder which is faster,
your Sand or my Sound?

685
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,231
When the moon is full...

686
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,694
When the moon is full, his blood boils.

687
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,411
Wh-What the heck... are you?

688
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,092
<i>I see.
So this is the One-Tail.</i>

689
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,324
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

690
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,042
<i>A Tailed Beast,
brought into this village?!</i>

691
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:39,591
There's no denying its power.

692
00:47:39,976 --> 00:47:42,643
But, are you able to control it?

693
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:44,819
At that level, yes.

694
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:47,712
But when the One-Tail transforms
completely and activates his

695
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:50,790
Playing Possum Jutsu,
there's no stopping him.

696
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,916
Fine. So don't agitate him now.

697
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:58,695
I'll look forward to seeing him
run amok when the time is right.

698
00:47:58,828 --> 00:48:00,724
But, are you all right
with what happened?

699
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:01,673
He was one of the Sound's—

700
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:05,073
It's fine. He outlived
his usefulness long ago.

701
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:08,368
I thought he was just
a guinea pig to test...

702
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,540
the power of the boy
called Sasuke, or something...

703
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:14,320
<i>Why... is he with the Sand ninja?</i>

704
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:18,380
No, that's not necessary anymore...

705
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:23,135
Actually, I'd already been ordered
to seize Sasuke.

706
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,669
But I failed...

707
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:27,406
What did you say?

708
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:31,227
It's also been found out that
I'm a minion of the Sound.

709
00:48:32,186 --> 00:48:35,606
I heard...
that you're Orochimaru's right-hand man.

710
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:40,232
So you were exposed, and yet
you still come to meet with me so nonchalantly?

711
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:42,363
You must be a fool.

712
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:45,491
I let them find out.

713
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:51,288
I wanted to see how far
the Leaf Village would go...

714
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:55,501
Even after that it wouldn't
be too late to seize Sasuke.

715
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:59,890
If you guys are going to fail,
we'll back off immediately...

716
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:03,605
It's a plan that was originally
posed by the Sound, so.

717
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,446
The Sand remains in the shadows
until the last moment.

718
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:13,018
This is the will of the Kazekage.

719
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,020
<i>This can't be...</i>

720
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,438
That's fine.

721
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,936
This is the Sound's instructions.

722
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,091
Okay.

723
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:28,793
And please... tell them about
this plan soon.

724
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:30,952
Yeah.

725
00:49:31,996 --> 00:49:32,997
I know.

726
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:37,376
Okay, I'll be going.

727
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,188
<i>To think our allied nation,
the Village Hidden in the Sand,</i>

728
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:42,256
<i>has already allied with the Sound...</i>

729
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:45,050
<i>I must tell Lord Hokage about this quickly.</i>

730
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:48,304
I'll take care of the cleanup.

731
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:51,849
No, I'll do it...

732
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:54,852
As the member of Sand Village
of the Land of Wind,

733
00:49:55,086 --> 00:49:58,548
I must do what I can for my allies...

734
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:02,443
Besides... it's just one mouse.

735
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,528
It'll be easy.

736
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,097
You're mine!

737
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,581
How unexpected.

738
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,542
I thought that it would
be settled right away.

739
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:13,344
I have to say...

740
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:16,891
That proctor was skilled
to have slipped past me.

741
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,154
<i>He's sheathing his sword?</i>

742
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:23,405
<i>Leaf Style:</i>

743
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,312
<i>Crescent Moon Dance!</i>

744
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:40,231
It won't come loose!

745
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:42,858
Your swordsmanship
is impressive.

746
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,578
However, the blow from
a real sword can be stopped.

747
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:47,645
But...

748
00:51:49,716 --> 00:51:52,918
But a blade of wind...
cannot be stopped by anyone!

749
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:26,360
Nice, nice.

750
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:28,917
Hey...

751
00:52:30,395 --> 00:52:33,982
Okay... I'll teach you a technique.

752
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,070
Do you really mean that?

753
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:44,017
Do you remember what I told you
yesterday about the two types of chakra?

754
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,519
Huh? Yesterday's talk?

755
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,826
You know, what you said about blue
and red chakra or something.

756
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:54,486
Oh... What about it?

757
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:59,115
You said that when a great power
came out, you felt red chakra.

758
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,295
Yeah, it was like that.

759
00:53:02,545 --> 00:53:06,048
Try building up that red chakra right now.

760
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,991
Hmm. Even if you say so...

761
00:53:10,476 --> 00:53:12,087
I'll give it a try, but...

762
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:22,348
How about it?

763
00:53:22,405 --> 00:53:25,116
Hmm, it's not right.

764
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:27,258
It's the same chakra as always.

765
00:53:27,612 --> 00:53:31,199
Jeez, you have no talent.

766
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,084
Don't talk so high and mighty!

767
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:35,251
In the first place,

768
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:38,737
I really don't understand those
two types of chakra myself!

769
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:41,022
Just keep trying.

770
00:53:44,178 --> 00:53:48,098
<i>Hmph... So he doesn't even realize it himself.</i>

771
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:50,299
<i>It seems Naruto himself still hasn't
realized that</i>

772
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:55,037
<i>the red chakra is
the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra.</i>

773
00:53:55,505 --> 00:53:58,383
<i>Well, guessing from his story...</i>

774
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:01,986
<i>it seems the excitement of danger
and heightened emotion</i>

775
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:04,848
<i>are the key to summon
the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra.</i>

776
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,737
No good, not good,

777
00:54:07,762 --> 00:54:10,390
Only the usual chakra's coming out.

778
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:12,408
Say, Pervy Sage...

779
00:54:12,591 --> 00:54:16,672
What the heck does the red chakra and
the technique you're going to teach me

780
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:18,782
have to do with each other?

781
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:20,344
Listen, boy.

782
00:54:22,548 --> 00:54:24,175
For the technique
I'm about to teach you,

783
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,787
the chakra you've had until now
is not nearly enough.

784
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:34,251
Therefore, you'll have to be able to
pull out and use the "other" chakra

785
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:38,280
that has been dormant within
you at any time you need.

786
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:44,753
But how do you know that
I have such a chakra?

787
00:54:45,221 --> 00:54:47,473
Oh, just what I wanted to hear.

788
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:49,615
Actually...

789
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,977
it's because I'm a sage.

790
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:56,739
Jeez... that's no answer.

791
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,999
Anyway, the special chakra
that only you have

792
00:55:00,112 --> 00:55:02,489
will become your greatest weapon.

793
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,407
Greatest weapon?

794
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:09,329
Not using that is like wasting treasure.

795
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:12,996
There's no need to force yourself
to do the same training as everyone else.

796
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:20,215
For someone like you, who has two kinds
of chakra and doesn't tire easily,

797
00:55:20,398 --> 00:55:23,568
should release the largest amount
of chakra you can

798
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:28,103
and should train to increase the
total amount of chakra you can wield.

799
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:32,560
Then there are tons of jutsu
and techniques you can use.

800
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,259
What, for example?

801
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:42,886
For example... the Summoning Jutsu
that I'm going to teach you now.

802
00:55:43,653 --> 00:55:44,821
Summoning?

803
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:46,235
Right.

804
00:55:48,176 --> 00:55:50,887
It's a type of
spatio-temporal technique

805
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:54,374
where you sign a contract in blood
with all kinds of living creatures

806
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:56,318
and summon them whenever
you like with ninjutsu.

807
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:03,823
Oh! That sounds awesome.
Teach me quickly!

808
00:56:04,692 --> 00:56:07,153
Before that...

809
00:56:07,404 --> 00:56:11,742
first, it's necessary to
use up all of your usual chakra.

810
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:13,799
Okay!

811
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:16,964
Leave it to me.

812
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:26,364
Well... So you can use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

813
00:56:27,448 --> 00:56:31,452
Listen up! We're having a battle royale!

814
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,998
The last one left will be
the strongest me...

815
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:38,373
We're going to determine
which one of me is the real me!

816
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:39,961
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

817
00:56:40,382 --> 00:56:44,803
I see... For someone who's not too
bright, you've put some thought into this.

818
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:03,643
Sure enough, I'm the strongest me.

819
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:13,449
It looks like you've finally used up
almost all of your chakra.

820
00:57:14,537 --> 00:57:16,873
Now, at last I'll teach you
the technique.

821
00:57:18,374 --> 00:57:19,565
Oh, I've been waiting!

822
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:22,923
First, I'll show you.

823
00:57:23,445 --> 00:57:24,947
Watch carefully.

824
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,928
<i>Summoning Jutsu</i>

825
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:41,064
Ooh, so cool.

826
00:57:52,784 --> 00:57:55,203
Open that scroll.

827
00:57:56,137 --> 00:57:58,806
It's the summoning contract for the toads,

828
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:01,166
that I've taken over from generations.

829
00:58:02,377 --> 00:58:03,920
Sign your name in your own blood

830
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,424
and stamp the fingerprints of one hand
in blood under that.

831
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:13,388
Then build up chakra in the place
you want to summon

832
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:15,598
and set down the hand you contracted.

833
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:20,228
The signs are
Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

834
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:28,787
U-zu-ma-ki

835
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:31,275
Na-ru-to.

836
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:45,128
Okay... This is fine, right?

837
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:50,633
It's easier for you to release
red chakra right now.

838
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:52,802
So give it a try.

839
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:54,804
I already am.

840
00:58:55,596 --> 00:58:59,058
Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

841
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:02,645
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!</i>

842
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:11,305
<i>A tadpole...</i>

843
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:15,514
<i>This kid... has no talent, after all.</i>

844
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:37,096
Hayate... what in the world happened?

845
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:54,243
Hey! Geez.

846
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,035
Hey, Pervy Sage!

847
00:59:59,243 --> 01:00:01,954
Weren't you going to
watch my training?!

848
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:04,443
I'm researching now.

849
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:05,831
Do it yourself!

850
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:11,506
All right, then I'll summon a frog,
a frog so big you'll be shocked!

851
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:16,645
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

852
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:22,787
W-Wait a minute!

853
01:00:24,101 --> 01:00:25,728
What part of that's a frog?!

854
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:28,529
If you don't get serious,
I won't help you!

855
01:00:28,554 --> 01:00:31,755
Shut up! I am being serious!

856
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,749
Then somehow draw out your chakra
as if your life depended on it!

857
01:00:35,774 --> 01:00:37,651
That's what I'm doing!

858
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:45,864
Some of you have probably
already heard but...

859
01:00:46,244 --> 01:00:50,248
Gekko Hayate's corpse was
found near Kikyo Castle...

860
01:00:50,532 --> 01:00:52,242
What... Hayate?

861
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:53,632
No way...

862
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,090
That's ridiculous!

863
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,270
Was the opponent Orochimaru?

864
01:00:58,624 --> 01:01:01,543
No... we shouldn't jump to
that conclusion so easily.

865
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:06,143
The one Hayate was following
was likely a Sound spy called Kabuto...

866
01:01:07,172 --> 01:01:10,592
Well, it's certain that Orochimaru
is trying to do something but...

867
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,986
So... we'll cancel the Chunin Exam
and go after Orochimaru...?!

868
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:19,231
No, he revealed his identity to Anko...

869
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:21,884
sending us a threat not to cancel.

870
01:01:22,093 --> 01:01:24,003
Not to cancel the Chunin Exam

871
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:27,156
for which all the ninja of
the Alliance have gathered!

872
01:01:27,755 --> 01:01:29,173
What does it mean?

873
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:34,564
Orochimaru has enough power to take down
a small nation on his own.

874
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:39,927
He's a ninja that probably
every Land has its eyes on.

875
01:01:41,137 --> 01:01:43,155
Moreover, he conveniently holds
a grudge

876
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,890
against this Village Hidden
in the Leaves.

877
01:01:45,696 --> 01:01:47,489
Any Land would desire him.

878
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:48,728
So could it be...

879
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,357
that any Land in the Alliance
would unite with Orochimaru

880
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,405
and betray the Village Hidden
in the Leaves?!

881
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:59,248
After all, these alliance treaties are
hardly worth the paper they're written on!

882
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:03,008
As was in the former Great Ninja War...

883
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:04,954
In any case,

884
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:08,286
there's too little information
right now.

885
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,738
Let's end these unnecessary
suspicions.

886
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,822
We've already dispatched ANBU,

887
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:15,100
the black ops to each Land
to collect information.

888
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,946
It's dangerous to act carelessly...

889
01:02:18,323 --> 01:02:21,076
That could be what the enemy
is aiming for.

890
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:23,345
And also...

891
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,058
When the time comes,

892
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:30,878
we'll bring all the powers of the
Hidden Leaf Village together and fight!

893
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:37,187
Huh?

894
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:39,364
Should I bring get-well flowers?

895
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,676
<i>So pretty.</i>

896
01:02:49,688 --> 01:02:50,688
<i>Oh no!</i>

897
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:56,194
Oh... How unusual for you to come
by to buy our flowers.

898
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:59,701
N-Not really!
Why would you care?

899
01:03:00,412 --> 01:03:03,040
Besides, isn't it unusual that
you're minding the shop?

900
01:03:05,335 --> 01:03:06,712
<i>I'll choose quickly.</i>

901
01:03:07,013 --> 01:03:09,367
People don't like flowers with
roots when they're in the hospital

902
01:03:09,392 --> 01:03:11,552
since they don't want to
be "rooted" in the hospital...

903
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:14,209
So cut flowers are
the proper thing to bring.

904
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:17,093
Wh-What are you talking about...?

905
01:03:17,636 --> 01:03:18,971
Playing dumb won't work!

906
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:21,733
You're going to see Sasuke, right?

907
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:27,176
Mom! I'm going out for a bit!

908
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:29,513
I-Ino?!

909
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:33,375
I won't let you be the first to visit!
I'm going with you!

910
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:35,989
A get well visit!

911
01:03:37,383 --> 01:03:39,343
<i>Shucks... Ino-pig!</i>

912
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:43,884
I'm taking this flower...

913
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:46,284
One "rose" of love!

914
01:03:47,672 --> 01:03:48,923
That's so cliché...

915
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:52,226
Then I'll choose this one.
A narcissus!

916
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:56,226
A noble flower that doesn't
succumb to the cold of the winter,

917
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,885
but hopes for the spring and
waits with dignified presence...

918
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:03,578
<i>with the wish for release from
the hospital as soon as possible.</i>

919
01:04:03,963 --> 01:04:06,257
You've gotten pretty knowledgeable.

920
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,293
I told you I wouldn't lose to you!

921
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:11,668
Oh, yes, yes, so one narcissus, right?

922
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,681
Uh... I need two.

923
01:04:13,706 --> 01:04:16,167
Why? One is fine.

924
01:04:16,487 --> 01:04:18,662
No... One for Lee too.

925
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:23,966
More, please!

926
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:25,141
- Huh?!
- Huh?

927
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:27,499
Ten orders of kalbi!

928
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:36,667
You sure can eat.
Just watching you makes me feel ill.

929
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,554
Here you are!

930
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,540
It's here!

931
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:46,415
This is mine, all right?
Don't eat any of it, Shikamaru!

932
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:48,574
I won't eat any!

933
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:53,788
What's going on with you guys,
barbecue in the middle of the day?

934
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:54,986
- Oh...?
- Huh?

935
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:56,550
Ino and Sakura...

936
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:59,919
Shikamaru, shouldn't you be going through
some special training or something

937
01:04:59,944 --> 01:05:01,391
to prepare for the Final Round?

938
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:02,652
I am...

939
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:04,493
Every single day...

940
01:05:05,043 --> 01:05:07,128
Asuma is so persistent.

941
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:13,194
Actually, Choji's been joining us
in the special training.

942
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:14,718
Really?

943
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:16,771
So you took it on?

944
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:22,089
Yup! In exchange, he's treating me
to as much barbecue as I can eat!

945
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:23,938
I see...

946
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:28,591
Oh, I shouldn't have held on
for the Final Round.

947
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,420
Don't be ridiculous!

948
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:33,312
There are numerous people who
want to participate, but can't!

949
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:34,320
From what I've heard,

950
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:36,639
they're doing some awfully
difficult things

951
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,374
over at Guy's and Kurenai's teams!

952
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:40,463
Wh-What's that?

953
01:05:41,043 --> 01:05:42,539
Even though we've made it this far,

954
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:45,335
getting totally thrashed
wouldn't be very cool...

955
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:50,470
Aw man, what a drag...

956
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,685
Whatever the circumstances,

957
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,670
we've exceeded human limits.

958
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:03,044
And I've used too much chakra...

959
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:06,151
Neji, are you all right?!

960
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:41,393
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

961
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:45,941
What?! A tadpole again?!

962
01:06:46,191 --> 01:06:48,651
You haven't made
any progress whatsoever!

963
01:06:48,747 --> 01:06:51,917
See?! It's bigger
than the ones from earlier!

964
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,033
How the heck should I know?!

965
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,769
So you want to see
Sasuke Uchiha...?

966
01:07:04,514 --> 01:07:05,681
Just five minutes.

967
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:08,283
I can't allow you to visit
any longer than that.

968
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:12,357
His body still needs to rest...

969
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:13,950
Yes...

970
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:17,410
Sasuke. You have visitors...

971
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,343
Two cute young ladies...

972
01:07:19,788 --> 01:07:20,330
Oh...!

973
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:21,484
- Huh?
- Huh?

974
01:07:23,026 --> 01:07:25,362
Sasuke, Sasuke?

975
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:29,057
His clothes are gone!

976
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:29,924
- What?!
- What?

977
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,136
This is terrible!
He's in no condition to be out of bed!

978
01:07:33,643 --> 01:07:35,395
Doctor! Doctor!

979
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,761
<i>Sasuke... Where in the world
have you gone...?</i>

980
01:07:58,136 --> 01:07:58,917
Hey...

981
01:08:00,735 --> 01:08:01,945
So you've finally come.

982
01:08:08,899 --> 01:08:12,277
Kakashi! Make me stronger!

983
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:19,911
<i>This determination of Sasuke's...</i>

984
01:08:21,392 --> 01:08:22,685
<i>He's dead serious.</i>

985
01:08:23,922 --> 01:08:26,841
Naruto got to
that level so quickly.

986
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,052
I can't waste any time.

987
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:32,840
<i>I see, so that's what it is.</i>

988
01:08:33,549 --> 01:08:37,970
<i>He finally took notice of
Naruto's immense power.</i>

989
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:40,806
I have a goal.

990
01:08:41,002 --> 01:08:42,587
I want more power.

991
01:08:43,108 --> 01:08:44,109
That's fine.

992
01:08:44,493 --> 01:08:46,912
Sasuke, you know about
chakra nature transformation,

993
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:48,981
of the five types of chakra,
don't you?

994
01:08:49,356 --> 01:08:50,172
Yeah...

995
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:54,319
The Uchiha Clan possesses
the Fire Nature

996
01:08:54,361 --> 01:08:56,071
and specializes in the Fire Style.

997
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,884
Why are you bringing that up now?

998
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:01,101
There are superior shinobi
who possess

999
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:04,087
more than two
change-in-chakra-natures.

1000
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,053
My change-in-chakra-nature
is lightning.

1001
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:11,295
Sasuke, for a long time,

1002
01:09:11,336 --> 01:09:14,673
I have sensed that
you are similar to me.

1003
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:18,588
I want to verify what
your change-in-chakra-nature is.

1004
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:25,601
I may be able to pass on
my jutsu to you.

1005
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:31,023
The one and original jutsu of
Kakashi, the Copy Ninja.

1006
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,634
Lee, you have visitors.

1007
01:09:36,335 --> 01:09:37,920
Two cute young ladies...

1008
01:09:38,293 --> 01:09:38,960
Oh?!

1009
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,198
- Huh?!
- Huh?!

1010
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:43,276
Really... even Lee!

1011
01:09:43,822 --> 01:09:45,532
Lee! Lee!

1012
01:09:45,873 --> 01:09:46,873
Lee...

1013
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:47,914
Huh?

1014
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:49,424
Look!

1015
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:50,384
Huh?

1016
01:09:55,752 --> 01:09:57,963
200 one-armed pushups...

1017
01:09:58,253 --> 01:10:01,506
If I can't do them, I'll do
100 one-legged squats...

1018
01:10:03,592 --> 01:10:05,427
190...!

1019
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:15,632
Lee! Stop it!
Lee! Stop it!

1020
01:10:15,657 --> 01:10:17,868
191...

1021
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:19,907
Lee!

1022
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:21,266
Please don't touch me!

1023
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:27,205
Don't... interfere...
with my training...

1024
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,294
<i>I need two...</i>

1025
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,862
<i>Why? One is fine.</i>

1026
01:10:36,288 --> 01:10:38,416
<i>No... One for Lee too...</i>

1027
01:10:42,807 --> 01:10:47,475
<i>Speaking of which, Sakura,
did you hear about Lee?</i>

1028
01:10:47,879 --> 01:10:49,589
<i>What? Hear what?</i>

1029
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:52,896
<i>Well, Lee...</i>

1030
01:10:53,438 --> 01:10:57,693
<i>his injuries were serious and
he can no longer...</i>

1031
01:10:57,718 --> 01:10:59,970
<i>continue as a shinobi.</i>

1032
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,691
195...

1033
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:14,287
196...

1034
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:19,491
197...

1035
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,803
198...

1036
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:31,185
I'm... not finished... yet!

1037
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,360
<i>There's no value in making
an effort for someone</i>

1038
01:11:36,648 --> 01:11:38,442
<i>who doesn't believe in himself!</i>

1039
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:57,760
One... one hundred... ninety... nine...

1040
01:12:02,216 --> 01:12:04,843
One... One more...

1041
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:09,181
One more time...!

1042
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,494
- Huh?!
- Oh!

1043
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:15,356
Lee!

1044
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,210
I'll... go get the stretcher.

1045
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:22,611
Please keep an eye on him.

1046
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:23,707
Yes.

1047
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:43,840
Why do boys...
have to push themselves so hard?

1048
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:05,237
Who brought that...?

1049
01:13:13,537 --> 01:13:16,832
Today, we'll have
a history lesson outside.

1050
01:13:17,332 --> 01:13:22,379
As you know, this rock face has
the faces of the Hokage line.

1051
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:25,112
In order from the left,
they're lined up from the First,

1052
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:32,348
the Second...
the Third... and the Fourth.

1053
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:37,478
<i>So different from the old man now.</i>

1054
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:39,430
<i>Especially the receding hairline...</i>

1055
01:13:39,455 --> 01:13:42,792
Iruka-sensei! Who's the Fifth?

1056
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:43,979
Hmm?

1057
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,873
Well, that hasn't been decided yet...

1058
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,591
Perhaps it's your teacher here!

1059
01:13:51,516 --> 01:13:58,003
Hmm... Weaving an occasional joke
to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?

1060
01:13:58,081 --> 01:13:59,333
L-Lord Hokage!

1061
01:13:59,396 --> 01:14:00,689
Oh, it's the Third.

1062
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:03,420
Hey! Old man!
What did you come to do?

1063
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:07,090
I wanted to see the rock faces too.

1064
01:14:07,299 --> 01:14:10,469
You've come at a good time.
Over this way, my lord.

1065
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:18,401
This is the real man of
the third rock face!

1066
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:20,228
The Third Hokage!

1067
01:14:20,942 --> 01:14:24,195
You all are quite young,
unlike me!

1068
01:14:24,735 --> 01:14:29,323
There might be someone in this group
who will become Hokage.

1069
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:31,606
You only have one life!

1070
01:14:31,879 --> 01:14:34,131
Don't choose an impossible road.

1071
01:14:34,648 --> 01:14:37,401
You can live as you please
and die as you please.

1072
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:39,373
However...

1073
01:14:45,395 --> 01:14:47,939
no matter what route you take,

1074
01:14:48,024 --> 01:14:51,111
remember to protect the
people important to you!

1075
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:53,041
Important people?

1076
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:58,985
That you acknowledge...
trust and love from your heart.

1077
01:14:59,101 --> 01:15:01,311
Do you have people like that?

1078
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:05,524
Y-Yeah... Dad and Mom...

1079
01:15:05,857 --> 01:15:08,527
and I hate him a little,
but my big brother too.

1080
01:15:08,777 --> 01:15:11,113
And...
my dog Gonta...

1081
01:15:11,613 --> 01:15:13,323
For me, it's friends!

1082
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:15,491
Me too!

1083
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,956
Lord Hokage, you have
people like that too?

1084
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,940
Yes, of course I do!

1085
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,169
Really! Who, who?

1086
01:15:26,586 --> 01:15:30,465
I have my grandchild...
Konohamaru over there and...

1087
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:38,272
All the people in this village!

1088
01:15:50,902 --> 01:15:55,615
Like you did too, once...

1089
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,795
C'mon, open your eyes already.

1090
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:04,666
Wh-What's that...?

1091
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,503
You really have no talent for this.

1092
01:16:08,618 --> 01:16:10,620
Oh! Pervy Sage!

1093
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:13,442
After training for 3 weeks,
you are still at this level.

1094
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:16,052
If you continue like this, it'll be pointless.

1095
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,270
That's not how it is!
I'm doing this with all my might!

1096
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:25,061
I understand that, if you really want
to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,

1097
01:16:25,306 --> 01:16:28,211
you have to do it like your life
depends on it, or it's no good at all.

1098
01:16:28,248 --> 01:16:29,933
That's what I'm doing!

1099
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:32,186
I push my chakra every day
like I'm going to die.

1100
01:16:32,211 --> 01:16:35,339
If you have time to complain,
teach me a trick or something!

1101
01:16:35,879 --> 01:16:38,673
A trick, huh... A trick.

1102
01:16:38,998 --> 01:16:40,997
What?! You're going to teach me?

1103
01:16:42,146 --> 01:16:43,981
You need to risk your life for it.

1104
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,412
L-Life?

1105
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:49,586
It's not a joke.
Even so, will you do it?

1106
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:54,229
O-Of course!
I always risk my life!

1107
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:55,722
I see...

1108
01:16:56,019 --> 01:16:56,943
Huh?

1109
01:16:56,968 --> 01:16:58,678
Well then, follow me.

1110
01:17:07,437 --> 01:17:10,398
Hey, if I do this I'll really get a frog

1111
01:17:10,528 --> 01:17:13,322
Yes, that's definite.

1112
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:14,954
Really?

1113
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:17,631
Do you have any regrets?

1114
01:17:17,683 --> 01:17:18,453
Huh?

1115
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:20,342
None?

1116
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:21,647
What are you talking about...?

1117
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:35,257
<i>To pull out enormous chakra
and use it.</i>

1118
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:38,357
<i>It is certain that it is difficult
to have the control to do it...</i>

1119
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:42,405
<i>It is also certain that this body
is a vessel too small</i>

1120
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,766
<i>to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra...</i>

1121
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,495
<i>It's likely that Naruto's body normally
tends to reject</i>

1122
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:50,855
<i>the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox
in order to avoid too much strain.</i>

1123
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:55,752
<i>If the excitement of danger and
emotion are the key</i>

1124
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:58,347
<i>to drawing out the
Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra...</i>

1125
01:17:58,551 --> 01:18:02,221
<i>he has to learn it with his body,
until using that key becomes instinct.</i>

1126
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:05,996
<i>Nothing personal...
Fourth Hokage!</i>

1127
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:21,052
Huh? Where... is this?

1128
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:22,970
Stand up!

1129
01:18:23,722 --> 01:18:25,932
Wh-What's going on?!

1130
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:27,726
Your training ends here.

1131
01:18:27,976 --> 01:18:29,978
Huh? I haven't done anything yet...!

1132
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,003
Naruto!

1133
01:18:31,478 --> 01:18:33,521
Go die once and come back.

1134
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:34,982
Die?

1135
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:39,808
From the jaws of death,
squeeze out that immense power!

1136
01:18:40,488 --> 01:18:44,409
Experience it with your own body,
and grasp the technique of it!

1137
01:18:45,035 --> 01:18:48,705
If you don't want to die,
do something about it yourself... Got it?

1138
01:18:57,895 --> 01:19:04,693
<i>Now... we'll see if the strength given
to you is really yours.</i>

1139
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:13,316
<i>If I don't grab onto this... I'll die!</i>

1140
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:18,942
<i>Now!</i>

1141
01:19:23,406 --> 01:19:24,616
<i>It's impossible...</i>

1142
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:28,536
<i>This rock surface is slippery
from the seepage of the waterfall.</i>

1143
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:33,124
<i>Besides, falling in that speed
with the control of chakra that you have,</i>

1144
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,502
<i>you can't cling to the rock.</i>

1145
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:39,464
<i>Naruto, after this...</i>

1146
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:41,783
<i>you can only depend on
the chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.</i>

1147
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:47,305
<i>Open up the key...
This time from your side!</i>

1148
01:19:49,224 --> 01:19:52,644
<i>If I go on like this!
If I go on like this! I'll seriously die!</i>

1149
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,938
<i>Die...</i>

1150
01:20:19,754 --> 01:20:20,441
<i>Huh?!</i>

1151
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,986
<i>This feeling... It's that chakra...</i>

1152
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:04,100
This is...

1153
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:18,521
<i>I-It's huge... What is it?</i>

1154
01:21:19,981 --> 01:21:24,110
Hey kid, come closer!

1155
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:36,331
I'd love to tear you to shreds,
but I can't get past this gate...

1156
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:39,626
Bloody seal...

1157
01:21:41,294 --> 01:21:42,294
You're...

1158
01:21:45,423 --> 01:21:47,133
the Nine-Tailed Fox!

1159
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:53,056
<i>I see... the red chakra
was this guy's chakra.</i>

1160
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:59,103
For you to approach me...

1161
01:21:59,938 --> 01:22:03,191
What business brought you here?

1162
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:09,239
Hey! You stupid fox!

1163
01:22:09,906 --> 01:22:15,912
You're living in my body,
so you can pay me rent with your chakra!

1164
01:22:22,255 --> 01:22:26,676
After all, if you die I die.

1165
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:30,580
You've got some nerve, threatening me!

1166
01:22:34,889 --> 01:22:36,140
That's fine...

1167
01:22:36,246 --> 01:22:40,416
As a reward for making it this far...
I'll give it to you!

1168
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:47,694
<i>This is the feeling!</i>

1169
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:52,615
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1170
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:05,795
Well done.

1171
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:12,135
Where am I?!

1172
01:23:18,516 --> 01:23:20,852
I've been saved.

1173
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,728
Oh?

1174
01:23:23,271 --> 01:23:27,025
Awesome... He's pretty damn big...

1175
01:23:28,318 --> 01:23:29,360
Oh yeah...

1176
01:23:38,745 --> 01:23:45,919
This is a... frog... isn't it...?

1177
01:23:50,882 --> 01:23:53,468
Whoa ah ah ah ah...

1178
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:56,763
Let's see now...

1179
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,477
No tail!

1180
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:04,437
This is...!

1181
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:06,314
Not like this one.

1182
01:24:06,898 --> 01:24:08,566
Or that one.

1183
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,276
It's really...

1184
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,402
A real...

1185
01:24:11,427 --> 01:24:13,054
Frog!

1186
01:24:15,506 --> 01:24:18,509
<i>Looks like he extracted the
chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox</i>

1187
01:24:18,534 --> 01:24:20,453
<i>all on his own this time.</i>

1188
01:24:21,243 --> 01:24:24,830
<i>But still, one certainly can't
say he's stable yet...</i>

1189
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:27,591
<i>He overused the large chakra...</i>

1190
01:24:28,055 --> 01:24:31,934
<i>To think that of all the frogs
he summoned that one...</i>

1191
01:24:32,548 --> 01:24:34,634
You little brat...

1192
01:24:34,659 --> 01:24:38,121
On whose head do you think
you're raising a ruckus!

1193
01:24:38,596 --> 01:24:44,686
This is the top of Gamabunta,
the Chief Toad's head! You idiot!

1194
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:46,729
Quiet down...

1195
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:49,481
Oh!

1196
01:24:56,489 --> 01:24:59,075
Wh-What the heck is this guy?!

1197
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,810
He seems pretty awesome, but...

1198
01:25:00,952 --> 01:25:02,328
Gimme a break!

1199
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:05,873
Just when I'm finally enjoying the air
of the outside world after so long,

1200
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:09,151
some weird kid is raising
a ruckus on top of my head.

1201
01:25:09,335 --> 01:25:13,548
Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!

1202
01:25:13,798 --> 01:25:17,489
What the heck do
you think you're doing?!

1203
01:25:18,386 --> 01:25:20,930
Hmm... This doesn't look good...

1204
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:25,393
'Cause even I can't handle
that Gamabunta...

1205
01:25:25,727 --> 01:25:29,461
Jiraiya! Hurry up and
show yourself, you idiot!

1206
01:25:30,398 --> 01:25:34,402
Hmmm... It would be a pain
if Gamabunta finds me...

1207
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:36,808
I'd better make a quick getaway.

1208
01:25:37,168 --> 01:25:39,462
Hey, little brat!

1209
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:40,760
Y-Yes...?

1210
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,079
Where's Jiraiya?

1211
01:25:43,411 --> 01:25:45,079
Huh? Jiraiya?

1212
01:25:45,429 --> 01:25:46,365
Who's that...?

1213
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:50,769
I'm talking about that lecher who
calls himself Toad Sage or something!

1214
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:53,863
Where's Jiraiya? Huh?!

1215
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,467
<i>S-Scary...</i>

1216
01:25:57,759 --> 01:26:00,595
If you just follow my orders,

1217
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:03,206
I wouldn't mind making you
my henchman!

1218
01:26:03,389 --> 01:26:05,975
Hurry up and answer me!

1219
01:26:06,617 --> 01:26:08,661
Okay! If you're talking about
the Pervy Sage

1220
01:26:08,686 --> 01:26:11,064
he's on the cliff up there,
Chief Toad.

1221
01:26:11,443 --> 01:26:12,986
Up there, huh...?

1222
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:16,381
Um... Can I ask you one question?

1223
01:26:16,694 --> 01:26:18,154
What is it?

1224
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:21,473
What business do you have
with that Pervy Sage?

1225
01:26:21,574 --> 01:26:25,119
That's the question I want
to ask that pervert!

1226
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:31,084
What the heck does he want
summoning me to a place like this?!

1227
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:32,993
B-But...

1228
01:26:33,127 --> 01:26:34,170
What is it?

1229
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:38,758
I'm the one who summoned
you, Chief Toad...

1230
01:26:38,783 --> 01:26:40,109
I fell off the cliff...

1231
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:42,553
and I was hoping you'd save me...

1232
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,097
Please...

1233
01:26:45,102 --> 01:26:46,520
Hmm?

1234
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:57,068
There's no way a little squirt like
you could summon a guy like me.

1235
01:26:57,093 --> 01:27:00,755
It's... it's true...
I really summoned you...

1236
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,267
Believe it!

1237
01:27:11,124 --> 01:27:12,792
You jerk frog!

1238
01:27:13,036 --> 01:27:13,834
Huh?

1239
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:15,670
You've been looking down on me

1240
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:17,697
and saying whatever you want
this whole time!

1241
01:27:17,964 --> 01:27:23,970
Since I summoned you, I'm your master!

1242
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:27,621
Huh? What was that?

1243
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:30,649
Hey, who do you think
you're talking to?!

1244
01:27:30,848 --> 01:27:31,953
A little squirt like you,

1245
01:27:31,978 --> 01:27:35,148
who I haven't even shared
a pledge of loyalty with,

1246
01:27:35,173 --> 01:27:37,425
has the nerve to claim he's the master
of the great Gamabunta?

1247
01:27:37,817 --> 01:27:41,404
I could kill you for that!

1248
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:42,988
Huh...

1249
01:27:53,947 --> 01:27:55,714
Oohhh...

1250
01:28:13,917 --> 01:28:16,773
Well, it looks like they've made it
to the surface.

1251
01:28:23,502 --> 01:28:25,754
Awesome...

1252
01:28:30,244 --> 01:28:32,409
I hate to tell you this, little brat,

1253
01:28:32,434 --> 01:28:34,038
but even if I'm being extremely generous...

1254
01:28:34,063 --> 01:28:35,958
No, a thousand times more generous,

1255
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:39,812
and even if it really was true that
it was you who summoned me...

1256
01:28:39,837 --> 01:28:43,007
If you're the kind of guy who
falls off my back that easily,

1257
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:46,870
there's no way I'd ever accept you
as my master.

1258
01:28:46,895 --> 01:28:48,563
Huh?! Huh?!

1259
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:53,559
Now then... I'm in the outside world
for the first time in a while...

1260
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:56,078
If Jiraiya doesn't have
any business with me,

1261
01:28:56,103 --> 01:28:58,940
I think I'll kick back for a while.

1262
01:28:59,482 --> 01:29:00,942
Hey! Wait!

1263
01:29:01,275 --> 01:29:04,362
Why don't you just go home
and sleep or something?

1264
01:29:04,654 --> 01:29:08,366
'Cause it looks like you're incapable
of serving even as my henchman.

1265
01:29:14,664 --> 01:29:16,165
Damn it!

1266
01:29:27,218 --> 01:29:29,720
Wh-What the heck do you think
you're doing, you little brat?

1267
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:32,198
If the only way to make you
admit I summoned you

1268
01:29:32,223 --> 01:29:34,225
depends on me not falling
off your back, then...

1269
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:39,380
Then I'll stay on your back all day,
no matter what!

1270
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:40,898
What?!

1271
01:29:41,315 --> 01:29:46,718
And by doing that,
I'll make you accept me as your master!

1272
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:52,368
You little brat! Don't get cocky
and think I'll go easy on you!

1273
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,077
Huh?!

1274
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:56,497
Fall!

1275
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,838
<i>Gotta stick with chakra!</i>

1276
01:30:06,469 --> 01:30:08,512
There's not enough chakra!

1277
01:30:09,562 --> 01:30:12,440
Listen carefully, Chief Toad!

1278
01:30:12,596 --> 01:30:15,182
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

1279
01:30:15,266 --> 01:30:18,102
I'm a man who will become Hokage
in the future. Don't forget that!

1280
01:30:18,185 --> 01:30:20,104
Who cares!

1281
01:30:29,256 --> 01:30:30,315
Welcome!

1282
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,884
I'm gonna eat my fill!

1283
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:36,162
Huh... Those guys are
eating barbecue again, huh?

1284
01:30:36,495 --> 01:30:39,498
A reward for training hard... maybe?

1285
01:30:39,874 --> 01:30:44,045
I thought you were told not to
let Gaara out of your sight...

1286
01:30:44,337 --> 01:30:47,089
Don't worry...
even somebody like him...

1287
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,760
wouldn't dare to do anything
in broad daylight.

1288
01:30:51,558 --> 01:30:54,561
More importantly,
that guy Shikamaru or whatever,

1289
01:30:54,627 --> 01:30:56,879
he's the first guy
you're fighting, right?

1290
01:30:57,402 --> 01:30:59,738
Shouldn't you be planning your strategy?

1291
01:31:00,272 --> 01:31:04,276
Hmph... There's no way I would
lose to a guy of that level...

1292
01:31:04,468 --> 01:31:05,468
Besides...

1293
01:31:05,538 --> 01:31:06,748
You botched it, didn't you?

1294
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:07,659
Huh?

1295
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:10,923
If you had taken the exam
one year earlier,

1296
01:31:10,948 --> 01:31:13,464
you would have made Chunin easily...

1297
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:16,117
Don't say it...

1298
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:23,267
What was that?!

1299
01:31:23,726 --> 01:31:25,769
The upcoming Chunin Exam...

1300
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:30,054
I'll have the three of you take the exam...

1301
01:31:30,716 --> 01:31:34,512
But the reason for doing that
is not to pass the Chunin Exam!

1302
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:37,472
It is to use the opportunity
of the Chunin Exam...

1303
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:40,000
to crush the Leaf Village!

1304
01:31:40,726 --> 01:31:46,482
But why? Don't we have
a treaty with Leaf Village?!

1305
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,932
That treaty is the problem.

1306
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:51,821
Oh.

1307
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:53,093
What do you mean?

1308
01:31:54,156 --> 01:31:57,201
You Genin are not aware of
the details but...

1309
01:31:57,508 --> 01:31:59,385
At the time the treaty was concluded,

1310
01:31:59,596 --> 01:32:03,726
that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind
not only aggressively scaled down

1311
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:06,921
the arsenal of
the Hidden Sand Village...

1312
01:32:07,545 --> 01:32:11,620
he delegated to the Leaf matters that
should have been handled by our country,

1313
01:32:11,645 --> 01:32:17,818
significantly cut our country's budget
and slashed the number of shinobi.

1314
01:32:18,347 --> 01:32:20,057
When we have an idiot leader,

1315
01:32:20,099 --> 01:32:22,601
we, the arms and legs
of the country, suffer.

1316
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:25,179
The only choice we had left
was to improve the quality

1317
01:32:25,204 --> 01:32:28,957
of each and every shinobi in order
to maintain our country's military power...

1318
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:34,029
That's why shinobi like
you were created...

1319
01:32:34,947 --> 01:32:35,976
Gaara...

1320
01:32:37,408 --> 01:32:42,329
The Land of Wind's security is
in extreme danger right now!

1321
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:47,476
But the aides
of that idiot feudal lord...

1322
01:32:47,674 --> 01:32:49,618
don't have a clue!

1323
01:32:50,687 --> 01:32:56,075
Lord Kazekage detected the decline
in our military strength,

1324
01:32:56,218 --> 01:32:58,304
joined hands with
the Hidden Sound Village

1325
01:32:58,329 --> 01:33:00,556
and decided to take down
the Hidden Leaf Village...

1326
01:33:01,641 --> 01:33:04,602
In addition to restoring the Sand
Village's authority...

1327
01:33:04,977 --> 01:33:07,377
this needs to be done in order
to make that idiot feudal lord

1328
01:33:07,402 --> 01:33:09,904
aware of the importance of military power...

1329
01:33:13,295 --> 01:33:16,340
If any more time passes,
our Sand Village will totally lose

1330
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:19,659
its military capabilities
against the Leaf Village...

1331
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:21,918
Now is the only chance...

1332
01:33:22,787 --> 01:33:27,792
The success of that mission,
Gaara, depends on your work...

1333
01:33:30,419 --> 01:33:31,587
Yeah...

1334
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:34,298
This is a super A-rank mission.

1335
01:33:34,715 --> 01:33:36,550
See it through with great care!

1336
01:33:37,218 --> 01:33:38,218
Okay.

1337
01:33:39,206 --> 01:33:40,206
Yes...

1338
01:33:43,974 --> 01:33:48,437
A day sure drags on when
there's nothing to do.

1339
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,092
<i>I guess...</i>

1340
01:33:57,154 --> 01:33:59,907
Good work, Baki.

1341
01:34:00,533 --> 01:34:04,578
Lord Kazekage, I successfully
advanced all three pawns

1342
01:34:04,603 --> 01:34:06,772
to the final round as planned.

1343
01:34:08,582 --> 01:34:11,919
The agreement with the Sound Village side
has also been progressing with no problem.

1344
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:13,002
Yes, sir.

1345
01:34:15,339 --> 01:34:16,382
This is...

1346
01:34:16,966 --> 01:34:19,802
A decisive action plan from
the Sound Village

1347
01:34:35,192 --> 01:34:36,986
You still have something you want?

1348
01:34:37,444 --> 01:34:38,444
Well...

1349
01:34:38,571 --> 01:34:40,781
What is it? Come out with it.

1350
01:34:40,864 --> 01:34:44,285
Yes, sir... I was wondering if you
could position some soldiers

1351
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,910
near the border on the pretext of
undertaking a tactical exercise.

1352
01:34:46,935 --> 01:34:48,144
With only the four of us...

1353
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:50,749
The Leaf Village aren't idiots either.

1354
01:34:51,341 --> 01:34:53,718
Their ANBU Black Ops are moving around.

1355
01:34:54,003 --> 01:34:57,756
If we do that, they'll see right
through our plan.

1356
01:34:57,879 --> 01:35:00,298
But with only our current
military capability...

1357
01:35:00,705 --> 01:35:03,250
That's why I sent Gaara and
the others out there.

1358
01:35:03,953 --> 01:35:09,458
The restoration of the Sand Village's power
rests on your shoulders.

1359
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:13,130
Well... Go.

1360
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,083
Yes, sir.

1361
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:29,705
How do you like that, Gamabunta?
I'm still on your back!

1362
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:32,708
It's my victory!

1363
01:35:36,545 --> 01:35:38,797
Oh no!
A fall from that height will kill him!

1364
01:35:49,438 --> 01:35:54,570
<i>Too bad for you... You almost made it.</i>

1365
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:02,864
<i>To think that he could hold out like that
against a tough opponent like Gamabunta...</i>

1366
01:36:13,499 --> 01:36:14,499
<i>Hm?!</i>

1367
01:36:17,331 --> 01:36:21,627
<i>That meddling Jiraiya...</i>

1368
01:36:21,913 --> 01:36:23,748
<i>I am fully aware of the fact that...</i>

1369
01:36:23,773 --> 01:36:26,818
<i>this kid summoned me all on his own.</i>

1370
01:36:27,346 --> 01:36:30,651
<i>I mean, it's the first time since
the Fourth Hokage</i>

1371
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:33,262
<i>that anyone has ridden on my head.</i>

1372
01:36:33,811 --> 01:36:36,855
<i>As might be expected,
he must be totally drained.</i>

1373
01:36:36,969 --> 01:36:40,848
<i>I don't mind lending him some
of my power, but...</i>

1374
01:36:41,318 --> 01:36:45,322
<i>Taking him to a place of healing
would be best.</i>

1375
01:36:48,842 --> 01:36:50,135
Huh? What!

1376
01:37:05,676 --> 01:37:06,676
Yo!

1377
01:37:07,136 --> 01:37:08,721
You finally woke up, eh?

1378
01:37:09,785 --> 01:37:12,121
Where... am I?

1379
01:37:12,349 --> 01:37:13,392
In the hospital!

1380
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:16,689
They told me that you've been
sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!

1381
01:37:17,646 --> 01:37:18,725
Three days...

1382
01:37:21,313 --> 01:37:22,844
It's such a drag but...

1383
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:25,738
I bought this fruit basket as
a get well present for Choji.

1384
01:37:25,946 --> 01:37:27,781
But the doctor said he couldn't have it.

1385
01:37:27,882 --> 01:37:29,096
So let's eat it together.

1386
01:37:29,499 --> 01:37:32,627
Choji? Is he that sick?

1387
01:37:32,969 --> 01:37:34,471
No, no, don't be fooled.

1388
01:37:34,747 --> 01:37:39,585
He got sick from eating
too much barbecue.

1389
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:42,791
That's just like him!

1390
01:37:43,005 --> 01:37:46,759
Yeah well, and neither of you are the type
to have female visitors.

1391
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,050
So here...

1392
01:37:49,771 --> 01:37:51,106
Looks good.

1393
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:55,267
Wh-What is it?

1394
01:37:56,909 --> 01:37:59,786
Since Choji can't have any,
let's eat in front of him.

1395
01:38:00,189 --> 01:38:02,357
What a drag this guy is!

1396
01:38:29,259 --> 01:38:31,428
<i>Why... save him?</i>

1397
01:38:33,263 --> 01:38:37,810
<i>He's an important subordinate
whom I care for.</i>

1398
01:39:05,879 --> 01:39:07,631
I'm still hungry!

1399
01:39:21,687 --> 01:39:24,940
Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?

1400
01:39:28,944 --> 01:39:31,697
<i>My body... isn't moving.</i>

1401
01:39:31,947 --> 01:39:33,699
You jerk!

1402
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:39,246
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

1403
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:42,541
Hey Naruto...

1404
01:39:43,041 --> 01:39:48,130
When I use my Shadow Possession Jutsu,
I have to move too! Okay?!

1405
01:39:49,131 --> 01:39:50,465
Sorry! Shikamaru.

1406
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:58,985
Choji, are you better?

1407
01:39:59,266 --> 01:40:00,726
Oh, Ino!

1408
01:40:05,898 --> 01:40:08,066
<i>All right! The age of
the chubby has arrived!</i>

1409
01:40:13,989 --> 01:40:16,992
What were you trying to do
to Bushy Brow here?!

1410
01:40:17,284 --> 01:40:18,911
I was trying to kill him.

1411
01:40:19,225 --> 01:40:20,225
What?!

1412
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:23,206
<i>How can he be so calm?</i>

1413
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:27,753
<i>Especially when he is not able to
move with my Shadow Possession Jutsu...</i>

1414
01:40:29,022 --> 01:40:31,358
Why'd you have to do something
like that?

1415
01:40:31,924 --> 01:40:34,217
You beat him in the match, right?

1416
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,847
Do you have a personal grudge
against him or something?

1417
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,267
I just wanted to kill him, that's it.

1418
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:45,694
How can you say something
so selfish, you bastard?!

1419
01:40:45,938 --> 01:40:49,066
You... you had a lousy upbringing,
didn't you?

1420
01:40:49,314 --> 01:40:51,233
All you care about is yourself.

1421
01:40:52,277 --> 01:40:56,365
<i>There's something weird about him.
It gives me the chills!</i>

1422
01:40:56,890 --> 01:41:00,686
<i>If he tries something, it'll be too much
for me and Naruto to handle...</i>

1423
01:41:01,078 --> 01:41:03,872
<i>What the heck should we do?</i>

1424
01:41:04,685 --> 01:41:07,854
If you get in my way,
I'll kill you both too.

1425
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:10,796
What?! Go ahead, if you can!

1426
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:12,197
Hey Naruto, hold on!

1427
01:41:14,049 --> 01:41:16,551
<i>Should I try to scare him with a bluff?</i>

1428
01:41:17,803 --> 01:41:21,223
I know you're strong from seeing you
in the competition with him...

1429
01:41:21,682 --> 01:41:26,103
But... we can keep up with you.

1430
01:41:26,812 --> 01:41:30,482
We didn't show you our best skills
in the Preliminaries.

1431
01:41:31,156 --> 01:41:32,699
And it's two against one!

1432
01:41:33,235 --> 01:41:35,028
You're the one who's at a disadvantage.

1433
01:41:35,424 --> 01:41:39,466
If you're smart, you'll do what
I tell you and just get lost.

1434
01:41:39,491 --> 01:41:43,370
I'll say it again...
if you get in my way...

1435
01:41:43,685 --> 01:41:44,685
I'll kill you.

1436
01:41:45,664 --> 01:41:47,064
<i>Where the heck do you get off...?!</i>

1437
01:41:47,499 --> 01:41:49,876
There's no way in hell
I'll let you do that!

1438
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,254
I've been telling you
to back off, haven't I?

1439
01:41:52,587 --> 01:41:56,008
This guy has the strength of a monster.
You get it, don't you?

1440
01:41:56,967 --> 01:42:01,847
I have a real monster in me!
I'm not going to lose to this guy!

1441
01:42:05,438 --> 01:42:08,357
Was it worth making him mad,
you idiot!?

1442
01:42:10,022 --> 01:42:11,314
A monster, huh...?

1443
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,487
Me too, actually.

1444
01:42:17,362 --> 01:42:22,034
It's just like you said.
I had a terrible upbringing.

1445
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:24,010
When I came into this world,

1446
01:42:24,035 --> 01:42:26,788
I took the life of the woman
some might call my mother.

1447
01:42:27,443 --> 01:42:29,821
So that I could become
the strongest shinobi...

1448
01:42:29,846 --> 01:42:32,474
my father performed a ninjutsu on me,

1449
01:42:32,499 --> 01:42:34,710
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.

1450
01:42:35,839 --> 01:42:38,133
I was born a monster.

1451
01:42:41,306 --> 01:42:45,644
<i>Is it possible... that there could be
something inside him too?</i>

1452
01:42:49,853 --> 01:42:54,066
What a thing for a parent to be doing!
Such a twisted kind of love.

1453
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:55,988
Love?

1454
01:42:56,234 --> 01:42:58,904
Don't measure me by your standards.

1455
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:02,073
Family, huh...

1456
01:43:02,365 --> 01:43:06,870
Let me tell you what kind of ties
I have to my family.

1457
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,081
They're ties of hatred,
ties of murderous intent...

1458
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,239
My family are just lumps of flesh to me.

1459
01:43:13,707 --> 01:43:16,376
Nourished with the life of my mother,

1460
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:19,831
I was crafted as the
ultimate weapon of the village...

1461
01:43:20,425 --> 01:43:22,302
The Kazekage's child.

1462
01:43:22,924 --> 01:43:25,969
I was taught by my father
the innermost secrets of the shinobi...

1463
01:43:26,516 --> 01:43:29,895
spoiled, overprotected,
and then abandoned.

1464
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:33,005
And I thought that was love...

1465
01:43:33,605 --> 01:43:37,818
Those who are too strong are
apt to become feared.

1466
01:43:38,568 --> 01:43:41,905
Born through the jutsu,
my mind was unstable...

1467
01:43:42,322 --> 01:43:44,241
I guess the idiots in my village

1468
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:47,285
finally realized that
I had emotional problems...

1469
01:43:48,495 --> 01:43:50,497
For my father, Kazekage

1470
01:43:50,865 --> 01:43:53,475
at the same time I was
the ultimate weapon for the village

1471
01:43:53,733 --> 01:43:56,343
I was also a dangerous,
fearsome presence.

1472
01:43:56,753 --> 01:44:02,008
It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure
as soon as I turned six.

1473
01:44:02,554 --> 01:44:07,184
People were only polite to me out of fear.

1474
01:44:07,782 --> 01:44:11,703
To them, now I'm just a relic of the past
that they want to see disappear.

1475
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:17,149
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

1476
01:44:18,024 --> 01:44:20,694
When I asked myself that,
I couldn't find the answer.

1477
01:44:21,862 --> 01:44:26,032
But, as long as you're alive,
you need a reason...

1478
01:44:26,753 --> 01:44:29,088
If you don't have one,
it's just the same as being dead.

1479
01:44:29,317 --> 01:44:31,444
What's this guy saying?

1480
01:44:34,207 --> 01:44:37,043
<i>I... can understand that...</i>

1481
01:44:37,794 --> 01:44:41,089
<i>He... is the same as me.</i>

1482
01:44:41,854 --> 01:44:43,982
So this is the answer I came to...

1483
01:44:44,885 --> 01:44:48,847
My existence is devoted to killing others.

1484
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:52,726
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,

1485
01:44:53,148 --> 01:44:55,108
finally I became calm.

1486
01:44:55,937 --> 01:45:02,527
By killing assassins, I finally
comprehended the reason why I live...

1487
01:45:03,278 --> 01:45:06,948
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself...

1488
01:45:07,782 --> 01:45:11,077
And if I see that all other people
in this world exist

1489
01:45:11,102 --> 01:45:12,978
only to make me realize that,

1490
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:15,335
there could be no world
more wonderful.

1491
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:19,753
And as long as there are
others to kill

1492
01:45:20,214 --> 01:45:24,052
who can make me feel
this happiness to be alive,

1493
01:45:25,091 --> 01:45:27,260
I will never disappear.

1494
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,387
<i>Wh-What's this freak talking about...?</i>

1495
01:45:29,804 --> 01:45:31,223
<i>He's completely insane!</i>

1496
01:45:31,651 --> 01:45:33,486
<i>I was also alone...</i>

1497
01:45:33,975 --> 01:45:37,103
<i>And suffered'cause
I didn't know why I was alive...</i>

1498
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:41,483
<i>But Iruka-sensei recognized me
for who I was...</i>

1499
01:45:41,566 --> 01:45:45,028
<i>and that was the first time
I realized why I lived...</i>

1500
01:45:45,695 --> 01:45:50,200
<i>But this guy...
this guy grew up alone.</i>

1501
01:45:50,659 --> 01:45:54,955
<i>And he only feels alive
when he kills other people.</i>

1502
01:45:57,624 --> 01:45:59,263
<i>H-How can there be someone like this?</i>

1503
01:46:03,755 --> 01:46:06,925
<i>The worlds we live in
are too different...!</i>

1504
01:46:10,345 --> 01:46:13,682
<i>There's no way...
that I can beat a guy like this!</i>

1505
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:24,484
<i>What? My Shadow Possession Jutsu
should be holding him, but...</i>

1506
01:46:30,521 --> 01:46:31,521
Naruto!

1507
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,743
Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!

1508
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,787
What a drag this guy is!

1509
01:46:36,121 --> 01:46:37,163
Naruto!

1510
01:46:37,747 --> 01:46:39,958
Now, let me feel alive...!

1511
01:46:40,375 --> 01:46:41,375
Oh no!

1512
01:46:41,918 --> 01:46:42,918
Stop right there!

1513
01:46:44,337 --> 01:46:45,797
Tomorrow's the final round!

1514
01:46:45,922 --> 01:46:47,966
There's no need to rush like this!

1515
01:46:49,676 --> 01:46:51,052
<i>Don't leave me alone!</i>

1516
01:46:51,469 --> 01:46:54,723
<i>I'm not bleeding, but
it hurts a lot right here.</i>

1517
01:46:58,685 --> 01:47:01,813
<i>What... am I?!</i>

1518
01:47:26,004 --> 01:47:29,382
I will... kill every last one of you.
