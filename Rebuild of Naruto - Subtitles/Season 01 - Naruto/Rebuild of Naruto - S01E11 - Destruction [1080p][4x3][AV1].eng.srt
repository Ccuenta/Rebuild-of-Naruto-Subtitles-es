1
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,184
Just my bad luck...

2
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,306
to have lookout duty
on a day like this.

3
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,976
I wanted to watch the Chunin Exam too.

4
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,435
Stop fussing.

5
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,855
The Chunin Exam takes
place twice a year.

6
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,816
You'll have many more chances
to see it.

7
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,153
But this year, that kid from
the Uchiha clan is taking part, right?

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,947
And I won't have
a chance to see that...

9
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,381
I can't die in peace now.

10
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,576
What's that?!

11
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,554
A giant snake!

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,459
Notify Lord Hokage immediately!

13
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,615
I won't let you into the village!

14
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,926
Dispatch reinforcements immediately!

15
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,763
Yes sir!

16
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,589
Sand Shinobi!

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,720
- <i>Start the operation!</i>
- <i>Start the operation!</i>

18
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:12,910
Lord Hokage!

19
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,526
Leave it to me!

20
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,572
Gaara!

21
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,202
Squad One, from above!

22
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,580
Squad Two, from below!
Protect the feudal lords!

23
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,630
You're in the way!

24
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,539
It's finally our turn.

25
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,947
We've been in disguise for so long.

26
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,741
I'm bursting with pent-up frustration.

27
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,577
You guys smell all sweaty!

28
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,205
Come on, we're all comrades, right...?

29
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,791
<i>Sound Shinobi...!</i>

30
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,086
Raido...

31
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,940
We're heading out to
back up Lord Hokage.

32
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,965
Be careful of any traps!

33
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,092
Do it...

34
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,802
Yes sir!

35
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,806
<i>- Ninja Art:
- Ninja Art:</i>

36
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,809
<i>- Four Violet Flames Formation!
- Four Violet Flames Formation!</i>

37
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,734
A barrier?!

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,663
Lord Kazekage...

39
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,002
Barrier ninjutsu, huh?!

40
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,604
To think they could outsmart the ANBU...

41
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,673
They're no ordinary shinobi...

42
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,637
What are you doing here?!
Lord Hokage is in danger!

43
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,974
What a nuisance...

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,861
To think the enemy was
masquerading as our own ANBU...

45
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,947
So he's the one who cast
the genjutsu too!

46
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,742
Yeah... there's no mistake.

47
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,038
What's going on?

48
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
Stop that, Gaara!

49
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,075
I'll kill him...!

50
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,267
There's no point in
continuing this fight!

51
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,132
Don't forget our mission!

52
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,091
Out of my way...!

53
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:45,628
What are you guys doing?!

54
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,264
The operation is already underway!

55
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,985
What in the world is going on?

56
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:06,611
Gaara!

57
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,950
What's the matter?!

58
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,117
His wound is deeper than
I thought!

59
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,334
Besides, his chakra is really low!

60
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,711
Idiot! It's all because
you didn't wait for the signal

61
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,963
and tried to fully transform...

62
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,715
What should we do?!

63
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,054
Are you saying we have to do
this without Gaara?

64
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,225
You two, leave for now and
tend to Gaara's wounds!

65
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,061
As soon as Gaara's chakra has
been restored...

66
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,021
the operation will recommence!

67
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,730
Got it!

68
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,651
What about you, Sensei?!

69
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,154
I'll hold them off!

70
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,663
Is Orochimaru the host of this party?

71
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,336
Who knows...
In any case, let's turn up the heat.

72
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,573
Sasuke...

73
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,138
Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.

74
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,267
You've already achieved Chunin level.

75
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,396
If you're a Leaf shinobi,
then serve the Leaf!

76
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,525
So, I just need to take down Gaara, right?

77
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,299
Picking up where we left off, right?

78
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,779
Don't pursue too far.

79
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:29,081
From here on out, it's no longer an exam.
It's the real thing!

80
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,160
What I have to do... is still the same!

81
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,162
I won't let him through!

82
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,171
<i>Sasuke...!</i>

83
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,591
Boy oh boy...

84
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,596
We intended to take Sasuke
while Gaara was causing a diversion.

85
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:56,387
But not everything goes as planned.

86
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,012
I see... Is that so?

87
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:07,344
So the Hidden Leaf and...
Sasuke were your targets?

88
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:10,456
Is the Leaf such a big prize?

89
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,453
More importantly,
if Gaara comes back,

90
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,706
I'll be able to show you something
much more interesting.

91
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,791
Well, anyway...

92
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,171
Your stubbornness has allowed
the Leaf to be outplayed.

93
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,673
It's my win.

94
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,470
Nothing is decided
until the very end.

95
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,306
I believe that's what I taught you...

96
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,769
Orochimaru.

97
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,107
I thought this day would
eventually arrive.

98
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,193
However...

99
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,031
You won't get my head that easily!

100
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,243
I told you, didn't I?

101
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,205
You should have
named a Fifth Hokage...

102
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,123
Third Hokage...

103
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,711
because you will... die here.

104
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,467
That Orochimaru...

105
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,135
What should we do?

106
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,775
Should we send reinforcements?

107
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,633
No. It's too dangerous to make a move
when we don't know...

108
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,742
the full situation.

109
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,437
If the mastermind is Orochimaru...

110
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,770
even more so.

111
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,068
Is Orochimaru... really that dangerous?

112
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,737
Long ago, when I was a kid...

113
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,492
there's one thing I remember
thinking when I saw that guy...

114
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,164
That he didn't seem human...

115
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,962
That he seemed like something
that had just taken on a human form...

116
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,177
Frightening...

117
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>Simply... frightening.</i>

118
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,557
Reporting!

119
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,704
A giant snake has appeared near
the East Gate of the Hidden Leaf!

120
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,106
And behind it, about a hundred
Sand ninja are infiltrating the village!

121
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,626
They are currently engaged in
armed conflict with our shinobi

122
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,730
who were patrolling nearby!

123
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,404
Squad One and Two will remain here.
All other units, head for the eastern gate.

124
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:14,255
Immediately!

125
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,276
- Yes sir!
- Yes sir!

126
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,419
This is as far as you go!

127
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,645
There's quite a large number.

128
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,150
We were careless!

129
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,385
And even Lord Hokage is under attack...

130
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,725
Kakashi! Look inside the barrier!

131
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,715
Yeah.

132
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,008
<i>What...?</i>

133
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,500
Orochimaru!

134
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,206
Orochimaru?!

135
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>Why is that guy...?</i>

136
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,546
<i>Don't tell me
they're after Sasuke again?!</i>

137
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,423
Sasuke!

138
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,468
<i>Huh?</i>

139
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,346
<i>He's not there...?</i>

140
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,673
Sakura, stay there for a while.

141
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,101
I'm going to go thin out their numbers.

142
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,548
Damn! I'm worried about
Lord Hokage, but...

143
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,341
Leave it to the ANBU.

144
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,092
Besides...

145
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,972
Lord Hokage isn't the kind of guy
who can be taken down that easily.

146
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:05,483
But...

147
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,355
After all, he is the Hokage
of the Hidden Leaf Village.

148
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,785
Are you so happy, you're crying?

149
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:26,737
Or...

150
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:34,552
do you feel even an iota of sadness in your heart
at the thought of killing me, your own teacher?

151
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,060
I was feeling so sleepy earlier.

152
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,396
But I'm wide awake now.

153
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,859
That's what I thought.

154
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,618
I know you aren't someone
who would hold a grudge.

155
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,538
You have neither a goal nor motive.

156
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,249
Hmm... I guess...

157
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,461
I do kind of have a goal.

158
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,880
If I were to explain it...

159
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,510
It's interesting to watch things
that move.

160
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,555
I get no pleasure if
something doesn't move.

161
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,498
Like a windmill that doesn't turn...

162
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,938
Well, it may have some kind
of appeal once in a while.

163
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,941
But usually,
it's not worth looking at.

164
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,363
Right now... with a wind I call
"The Destruction of Leaf"...

165
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,990
I want to turn that windmill.

166
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,703
You're the same as always...

167
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,336
Sakura!

168
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,675
It was worth teaching you
genjutsu survival training

169
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,160
during the Genin Exam.

170
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,721
You truly have a talent for it.

171
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,222
Huh?

172
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,893
Release the genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!

173
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,438
Naruto will be delighted.

174
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,606
He'll be getting a mission
after so long.

175
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,809
What do you mean by a mission?

176
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,821
Be careful...

177
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,576
It's your first A-rank mission
since the Land of Waves.

178
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:38,238
<i>I feel uneasy...
about that unusual chakra.</i>

179
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,762
But then,

180
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:51,092
we should wake up Ino and Choji
and go as a larger group.

181
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,393
There may already
be quite a large number

182
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:57,132
of Sand and Sound shinobi
who've infiltrated the village.

183
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,360
A squad loses speed when it has
more than the standard four members...

184
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,988
and it becomes difficult to
hide from the enemy.

185
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,118
You learned that in the Academy's
patrol practical training, right?

186
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:17,099
Oh, I see! So if it's a team of four,
does that mean you'll come with us?

187
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,793
No, I have to stay here.

188
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,669
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

189
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,511
Pakkun here will
track Sasuke by his scent!

190
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,933
D-Don't tell me...
the fourth member is this puppy?!

191
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:42,107
Hey, watch it little girl! Don't you dare
call me "cute" or a "puppy"!

192
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,653
<i>I didn't say... cute.</i>

193
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,949
Okay, Sakura! Release the genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru!

194
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,247
Okay!

195
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,132
<i>Release!</i>

196
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,310
What is it... Sakura?

197
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:19,907
Get down!

198
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,524
I'll tell you later!
Just stay down!

199
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:32,204
Shikamaru, you were awake
from the beginning...

200
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:37,119
Owwee!

201
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,873
You dispelled the genjutsu too?!

202
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,084
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!

203
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,254
Hmph! I don't want to
end up getting involved!

204
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,755
Heck no...
I couldn't care less about Sasuke!

205
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,303
Owwee!

206
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,601
W-What's going on...?

207
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,935
Naruto! Behind you!

208
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,691
S-So fast...

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,401
Not just fast...

210
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,321
Guy-sensei!

211
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,535
Now, I'll announce the mission!

212
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,677
Once you have your orders,
go through that hole.

213
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,167
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!

214
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,253
Then await further orders
in a secure location.

215
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,214
Huh? Did something happen
to Sasuke?!

216
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
I'll explain on the way!

217
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,342
Let's go!

218
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,056
Jeez... Why me?

219
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,557
Hey, boy!

220
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,600
Huh?

221
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,727
If this mission is a success,

222
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,022
as a reward I'll let you
touch my paw-pads.

223
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,815
So don't sulk like that!

224
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,775
Huh?

225
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,068
See?

226
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,320
They're soft and supple!

227
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,238
S-Supple...?

228
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,074
Yes, very...

229
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,620
Soft and Supple!

230
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,084
Let's just go!

231
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,295
H-Hey!

232
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,592
Will they be alright on their own?

233
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,387
They'll be okay.
Pakkun is with them.

234
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,639
<i>As long as they don't pursue too far...</i>

235
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,409
This barrier can only be broken
from the inside.

236
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:44,289
If Lord Hokage would just
take out one of those four,

237
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,707
we could help...

238
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,168
Put up a barrier on the inside, too!

239
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,561
Hmm... It seems I won't be able
to get out of this so easily.

240
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,605
You don't really mean that.

241
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:13,986
It would be more problematic for you
if someone else interfered, wouldn't it?

242
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,578
<i>Something's strange...</i>

243
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,331
<i>All the Academy classes
are on self-study.</i>

244
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:28,849
<i>And that smoke...</i>

245
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,373
<i>That's coming from the direction
of the exam arena.</i>

246
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>Isn't there some kind of disturbance
to the East?</i>

247
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>I wonder if something happened...</i>

248
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,243
<i>This is definitely strange!</i>

249
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,270
But this sudden self-study is
a real pain!

250
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:50,497
It's been like this for a while!

251
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,026
Yeah, Iruka-sensei
and the others are late...

252
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,195
Aren't they, Konohamaru?

253
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:04,326
We have reports that several enemy units
have already infiltrated the village!

254
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,458
We should evacuate the students
to a safe place right away!

255
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,087
Yes... And without causing panic
among the students!

256
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,132
Then let's evacuate the students

257
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:19,614
as soon as possible under
the pretense of an evacuation drill!

258
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,974
Did you foresee your final moments?

259
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,013
I won't go easy on you
just because you're doddering.

260
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,308
I look forward to it.

261
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,686
Depending on your jutsu,

262
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,314
I might have you
start over at the Academy!

263
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,194
Please don't disappoint me too much!

264
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,415
<i>Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

265
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,506
<i>Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation!</i>

266
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,048
<i>One!</i>

267
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,344
He's using a Summoning Jutsu
as a shield.

268
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,596
And this reanimated person...

269
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,763
<i>Two!</i>

270
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,060
I have to stop the third one,
no matter what!

271
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,519
<i>Three!</i>

272
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,619
<i>It looks like the third one didn't make it...
Oh well...</i>

273
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,551
I-It can't be!
Those figures are...!

274
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,887
Those figures are?

275
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:32,017
Now, what will you do,
Sarutobi-sensei...?

276
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,642
<i>No...</i>

277
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,823
Long time no see... Saru.

278
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,219
Oh, it's you...
You've gotten old, Sarutobi.

279
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:57,417
I never imagined I'd meet
the two of you again like this...

280
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:00,347
Please prepare yourselves...

281
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:01,866
Lord First Hokage...

282
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,049
Lord Second Hokage!

283
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,676
The Impure World Reincarnation...?

284
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:10,247
This youth summoned us with
that Forbidden Jutsu?

285
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,265
He's something else...

286
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,144
Then, Sarutobi!

287
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:21,230
Does this mean we must... fight you?

288
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,611
Enough with the old folks' reunion...

289
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,655
Shall we get started?

290
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,200
It's always about fighting...
no matter the era.

291
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,328
You like that, don't you?

292
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:39,134
No good can come from defiling the dead
and using them as tools!

293
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,927
I get it! So that's what happened!

294
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,836
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

295
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:57,185
Why do I have to get involved?
This is such a drag...

296
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,479
It can't be helped!

297
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:02,054
It's Kakashi-sensei's order.

298
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:06,998
This way!

299
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,674
How long will it be until
we catch up?

300
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,662
I don't know.
He's moving at a pretty good speed.

301
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:17,406
Damn it!

302
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,442
Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.

303
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,818
Huh? What is it?

304
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,862
Did you find Sasuke?

305
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:50,021
No!

306
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,691
There are eight people in
two squads behind us...

307
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:53,873
No...

308
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,579
There's one more...
That makes nine of them following us.

309
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,746
What?!

310
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,417
C'mon. Already?!
Give me a break!

311
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,553
They're probably all
Chunin or higher.

312
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,223
We'll be wiped out
if they catch up.

313
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,098
<i>Wiped out...</i>

314
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,607
Damn it! If it's come to this,
why don't we set up an ambush?!

315
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:24,075
Ambush?

316
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:25,633
Right.

317
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,110
Indeed, an ambush would
be to our advantage.

318
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:32,259
Even if the enemy has twice
as many people as we do,

319
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:34,204
if we just catch them off guard...

320
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,076
That's no good.

321
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:40,313
Our opponents are followers of the rogue
Leaf shinobi, Orochimaru.

322
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,959
In the worst case scenario,
there might be Jonin.

323
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:48,663
I thought it'd work,
but I guess not, huh.

324
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:51,027
Hold it. Why?

325
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,761
The level of opponent doesn't have
much to do with an ambush.

326
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,514
You guys don't get it.

327
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,811
Listen. Indeed, an ambush is
a very advantageous fundamental tactic.

328
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,092
But two conditions are necessary.

329
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:07,474
Number one.

330
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:12,309
The ones being pursued must move
silently and spot their pursuers first.

331
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:14,386
Number two.

332
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:17,139
One must be able to catch
the pursuers off guard,

333
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,246
secure a strategic point from which
to reliably inflict damage

334
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,290
and conceal oneself quickly.

335
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,628
An ambush only becomes effective
when these two conditions are ensured.

336
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,650
Well, the first condition
won't be so difficult

337
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,343
since we have the ninja Hound's nose
with us.

338
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,472
And the second one also
seems advantageous at a glance

339
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,101
since we know the geography
of our village.

340
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,155
Our pursuers have likely been 
briefed on this village's terrain

341
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,101
and run simulated exercises for
this kind of engagement.

342
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,443
And on top of that,

343
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:55,347
they're likely all ninja
skilled in the art of pursuit.

344
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,283
So they're prepared
for our usual tactics, huh.

345
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,871
Well, even so, the fact remains
that an ambush is advantageous.

346
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,128
But there are too many elements
of uncertainty.

347
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:10,503
For starters, the enemy is a special unit,
assembled specifically for this operation.

348
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,730
While we have...
a fool...

349
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,468
a Kunoichi who's nothing special...

350
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,677
a dog...

351
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:22,652
and me, the number one slacker!

352
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:27,456
A tactic is grasping the conditions
that are there without fail

353
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,481
and formulating an optimal plan.

354
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,444
And so, there's only one thing
that we can do now...

355
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,221
One?

356
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,491
A diversion in the guise
of an ambush.

357
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:43,167
One person will remain,
pretend to ambush,

358
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,954
and delay the pursuers.

359
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,917
If we do that, we'll be able
to shake off our pursuers,

360
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,004
but whoever acts as the decoy
will probably...

361
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:55,527
Die.

362
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,392
So, who's going to do it?

363
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,770
We need the dog to follow Sasuke.

364
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,035
That means...

365
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:19,428
Fine...

366
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,200
- I'll...
- I guess it has to be me.

367
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,575
Shikamaru?!

368
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,596
W-Why you?!

369
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,124
It's better than
being wiped out, right?

370
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
Besides, among us,

371
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,595
the only one who is
best suited to playing the bait

372
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,373
and who has the
best chance of surviving...

373
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,885
is me.

374
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:48,582
My Shadow Possession Jutsu was originally
designed as a stalling tactic, so...

375
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,021
Well, I'll catch up later!

376
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:53,960
Now get going

377
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:01,663
We're counting on you, Shikamaru!

378
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,707
<i>I never knew Shikamaru could
be this dependable.</i>

379
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,509
Their strides are irregular.

380
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,888
Urgency is probably increasing
their fatigue.

381
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,188
Sorry about that.

382
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,098
I'm supposed to be the one
who chickens out first.

383
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,530
Guess I'm not acting like
my usual self this time.

384
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,284
The fact that I'm tired is true.

385
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,411
Those footprints are wrong.

386
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,333
By the way, this is what
a real dog's paw print looks like.

387
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,547
Oh, he's still a kid.

388
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,467
To think we'd all get caught like this.

389
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,513
So this is the Hidden Leaf's famed
Shadow Imitation Jutsu?

390
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,673
Huh?

391
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,391
That's an old way of saying it!

392
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,186
The times are changing!

393
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,106
It's called the
Shadow Possession Jutsu now, you geezer.

394
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,198
<i>1, 2, 3, 4...</i>

395
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,702
<i>5, 6, 7... 8.</i>

396
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,245
<i>Eight people...</i>

397
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,999
<i>Eight... No, there's one more...</i>

398
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,210
<i>There are nine people following us.</i>

399
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,131
<i>Just as I thought. The ninth one's
role is to guard against an ambush.</i>

400
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,843
<i>That person
stays at a fixed distance,</i>

401
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,054
<i>stays in the rear to counter
any enemy attacks.</i>

402
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:55,979
<i>But... this will make clear where
that person's hiding!</i>

403
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,450
<i>There, huh?!</i>

404
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,953
<i>Damn... The Shadow won't reach.</i>

405
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,081
<i>I don't have enough stamina to
extend it further with my chakra.</i>

406
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,676
It looks like you're at your limit...

407
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,629
This Shadow Possession Jutsu
is going to break very soon.

408
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,256
Prepare yourself!

409
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:38,229
<i>I just wanted to be...
an average ninja,</i>

410
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,231
<i>make a decent amount of money,</i>

411
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,901
<i>marry a perfectly ordinary woman</i>

412
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,611
<i>who's neither beautiful, nor ugly</i>

413
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,863
<i>and have two kids, nothing special.</i>

414
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,408
<i>First would be a girl,
and then a boy...</i>

415
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,203
<i>I would retire from being a ninja
when my daughter married</i>

416
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,872
<i>and my son had become 
a respectable adult.</i>

417
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:59,881
<i>And then I'd take it easy
in my life of retirement</i>

418
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,252
<i>playing Shogi
and Go all day long.</i>

419
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,443
<i>Then I'd die of old age
before my wife.</i>

420
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,801
<i>Such a life would've been nice.</i>

421
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,672
<i>This was such a drag...</i>

422
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,270
As you said,
it seems I'm at my limit.

423
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,241
Hey, come on out.

424
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,798
While you're at it, cut off his head.

425
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,759
I finally caught up.

426
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,261
A-Asuma?! Why?

427
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,450
Well done, Shikamaru.

428
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,165
Heh... this really isn't my style.

429
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:25,731
<i>You can sit this turn out.
You've done enough.</i>

430
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,189
So what's up, Temari?

431
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,809
He's close.
He's just right there.

432
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,686
Damn it! What should we do?

433
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,065
Leave it to me.

434
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:11,874
That was close.

435
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,219
What was that noise?

436
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:22,643
An explosion...
Maybe it was a trap meant for Sasuke.

437
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,890
I wonder if he's okay.

438
00:34:26,796 --> 00:34:31,601
Don't worry...
He won't get taken out that easily.

439
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,451
Now then, shall we get started?

440
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,672
Before that, I must have you both
return to your original forms.

441
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,545
Please prepare yourself,
Sarutobi-sensei.

442
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,797
With every moment,
they are looking more lively...

443
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,508
What kind of jutsu is that?

444
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,677
Impure World Reincarnation.

445
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,807
It's a forbidden summoning jutsu that can bring
the dead back to the world of the living.

446
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:49,856
The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu
is the blood of the caster.

447
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,834
But I've heard that with this jutsu,

448
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,902
in order to summon
a dead soul to this world...

449
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:01,701
a living person's body is
sacrificed as a vessel for the soul.

450
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,330
Dust and dirt then cover
the sacrificial body

451
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,501
causing it to take on the original
appearance of the summoned soul.

452
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,380
And through the charm
embedded in the head,

453
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,008
the soul's personality is suppressed

454
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,969
and it morphs into no more
than a killing puppet.

455
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,432
They're complete.

456
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,854
They look like how they used
to look more than ever.

457
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:34,041
Do you know the joy and sense
of accomplishment

458
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,236
of hurting the man
you once called Sensei?

459
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:43,433
I prepared this scenario
so that you might know that joy.

460
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:46,159
So please enjoy it.

461
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,216
Lord Hokage!

462
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,761
Even if the shape and form
are the same...

463
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,806
they're neither the First Hokage
nor the Second!

464
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,101
I... know!

465
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,037
Here I go!

466
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,749
<i>Fire Style: Dragon Flame Bullet!</i>

467
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,322
True to the title
of the previous Hokage.

468
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,203
<i>Water Style: Water Shockwave!</i>

469
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,716
<i>Earth Style: Mud Wall!</i>

470
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,398
<i>Same mighty strength as always.</i>

471
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,579
<i>Fighting two of you at once is quite
a challenge, as expected...</i>

472
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,037
This is bad.

473
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,041
This is the First Hokage's secret jutsu.

474
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,254
<i>Wood Style Secret Jutsu:</i>

475
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,052
<i>Deep Forest Emergence!</i>

476
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,883
You're finally caught...
eh, Sensei.

477
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,392
Okay. Everyone's here, right?

478
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,188
Okay everyone,
let's evacuate quickly.

479
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,694
Don't rush and don't panic!

480
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,323
What's the matter, Konohamaru?

481
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,867
Does your stomach hurt or something?

482
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,205
No... it's not that.

483
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,223
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!</i>

484
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,557
Appear!

485
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,476
Monkey King: Enma!

486
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,325
Hmph...
Something pesky has appeared, eh?

487
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,456
Old Monkey Enma.

488
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:35,426
Orochimaru...
I knew it would come to this.

489
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,392
You're pathetic, Sarutobi...
If you had just killed him back then.

490
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,769
I'm going to do it now!

491
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,647
It's too late.

492
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,654
Please, Enma!
The Adamantine Staff.

493
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,200
Stop him! Don't let him complete
that transformation!

494
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,664
Okay... Got it!

495
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,465
<i>Transform!</i>

496
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,932
All right.

497
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,110
Wow... The level of ninjutsu here!

498
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,655
So this is Hokage level combat!

499
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:42,661
Oh well...
Things have finally gotten interesting.

500
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:57,442
<i>That's one of his Snake Swords.</i>

501
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,602
Let's do it, Enma!

502
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:11,774
No matter how strong the body,
the Snake Sword still hurts.

503
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,996
You're mine!

504
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:16,509
So foolish...

505
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:21,093
To think you'd strike without even
using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

506
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,513
Are you okay, Sensei?

507
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:28,100
Please hang in there.

508
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,687
You are called...

509
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:36,467
"The Professor" who knows every
jutsu in the Hidden Leaf, right?

510
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,279
Please don't disappoint me too much.

511
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,390
Lord Hokage!

512
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,164
Fool... It's too late.

513
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,519
You... fool!

514
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,518
Orochimaru...

515
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,934
This is the end.

516
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,979
I'll snap your neck.

517
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:11,386
<i>As I thought...</i>

518
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,040
<i>It looks like there's no point if
I don't do something about the soul itself</i>

519
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,359
<i>that is bound by
the Impure World Reincarnation.</i>

520
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:24,430
<i>If that's the case, my only option is to use...
the Fourth Hokage's jutsu...</i>

521
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:35,895
<i>Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,
please forgive me for using this jutsu!</i>

522
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:43,068
Sensei... it seems you're out of breath.

523
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:45,492
You've gotten old, haven't you?

524
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:49,945
I've never seen such a pained look.

525
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,415
What's so funny?

526
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,501
It's quite sad...

527
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:07,175
Old age gets the better of even you,
once hailed as the God of Shinobi.

528
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,680
What's that?!

529
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,932
What the heck is going on?

530
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,145
Who the heck is that youth?

531
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,316
Who on earth are you?!

532
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,945
Is it so sudden you can't tell?

533
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:30,282
It's me. Orochimaru.

534
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:37,247
It can't be... Have you perfected
that Forbidden Jutsu?

535
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,924
I struggled for decades...
after leaving the village.

536
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,594
You're a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!

537
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,522
So, he did it, huh...?

538
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,860
The reason I couldn't select you
to be the Fourth Hokage...

539
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,947
was because of that
twisted mind of yours.

540
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,421
I've finally been found out, eh...?

541
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,926
It's too bad.

542
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,430
Orochimaru...
What's the meaning of this?!

543
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,559
And here I'd set so
many booby traps...

544
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,896
so I was quite surprised.

545
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,483
But I see... So it was you.

546
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:50,665
Recently, there has been a steady stream
of people going missing from the village,

547
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:52,976
from Genin to Chunin,
and even members of the ANBU.

548
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:57,579
There were also tips that
you had been acting strange...

549
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,746
Master Orochimaru...

550
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,207
Why did a shinobi of your rank
do such a thing?

551
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,128
Shall I kill you, too?

552
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,883
Orochimaru! Sure enough,
this was your doing...?

553
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,470
Say it! What were you doing here?!

554
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,640
Alas! I've been found out.

555
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,393
Playing innocent won't help me...

556
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:25,980
It's for jutsu development!

557
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,192
As I thought, Forbidden jutsu, eh...

558
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,072
What is it that you want?

559
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:39,911
Learn every jutsu and understand
all the truths of this world!

560
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,623
The one who first mixed
blue and yellow

561
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,669
named the new color
that resulted, green.

562
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,548
I just want to do the same thing.

563
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:54,873
If blue is chakra, yellow is a sign...

564
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,054
and green is a jutsu.

565
00:50:57,779 --> 00:51:01,199
In the same way that there
are no limits to the kinds of colors,

566
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,728
there are likely tens
of thousands of jutsu in this world...

567
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:09,207
But in order to
learn all the jutsu...

568
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:14,654
as well as the truths,
a long time is necessary.

569
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:20,494
It's the one who takes those
long years to know everything,

570
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,830
who can truly be called
the ultimate individual.

571
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,711
For me, the life span of
the body is too short.

572
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,421
Too fleeting.

573
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:38,720
Even if one becomes Hokage,
if they die, it all ends there.

574
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:43,934
Orochimaru... Could it be that
the jutsu you're testing here is...

575
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,978
Right... It sure could be...

576
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,068
My Immortality Jutsu!

577
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,621
Immortality Jutsu is a technique of

578
00:52:04,826 --> 00:52:08,997
eternally transferring one's spirit
from one vessel to another...

579
00:52:09,156 --> 00:52:12,534
In other words,
it's a reincarnation jutsu where...

580
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,760
you find a new body, put your own spirit
into that body and take it over.

581
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,440
I assumed my old form until now,

582
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,606
so that you would feel nostalgic
about our reunion...

583
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,361
Growing old is so meaningless,
don't you think?

584
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,490
I feel that keenly when I look at you.

585
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,077
You'll die here...

586
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:49,772
and I'll get a younger,
more beautiful, and stronger body...

587
00:52:50,591 --> 00:52:54,554
The Leaf Village certainly provides
me with endless entertainment...

588
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,760
I see...
You're after Sasuke Uchiha!

589
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:09,436
Right... Exactly... Sasuke.

590
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,560
A jutsu to reincarnate by
stealing another's body

591
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,901
and immortalize your spirit?

592
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,280
How many faces and bodies
have you gone through?!

593
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,201
Two, I think...

594
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:29,915
I plan to take Sasuke over after
raising him a little more to my liking.

595
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:37,714
But after all, in order to
make you regret your very own life...

596
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,967
and curse destiny as you die...

597
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,305
Perhaps this face is more to your liking?

598
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,226
You monster!

599
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,906
Lord Hokage!

600
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:14,125
Don't lower your guard, Sensei!
You're always too soft...

601
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:24,514
What's been wrong with you?
This isn't like you!

602
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,845
I'm sorry...

603
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,525
Are you going to... kill me?

604
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:43,351
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

605
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:53,623
I wonder if you can...
Sarutobi-sensei!

606
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,394
Kill him, Sarutobi!
Now's your only chance!

607
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,875
Sarutobi... You...

608
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:40,245
I couldn't kill him...

609
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:47,177
I'll bury you and correct
my old mistakes, now!

610
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:49,929
Here I go!

611
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,101
It's too late!

612
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,440
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

613
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,277
No way!
Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!

614
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,113
He's dispersing what little chakra
he has left...!

615
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:11,148
You've gotten old, after all...

616
00:56:11,713 --> 00:56:15,341
To think you'd shorten your
own life out of desperation...

617
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,624
<i>D-Don't tell me, you?!</i>

618
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:23,880
Serpent, Boar, Ram, Rabbit,
Dog, Rat, Bird, Horse, Serpent.

619
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,801
<i>This order of Signs...</i>

620
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,553
<i>I knew it, Sarutobi,
you are using that jutsu!</i>

621
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:50,407
<i>So this is the Death God
the Fourth spoke of,</i>

622
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:54,902
<i>a being visible only to the caster?</i>

623
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:59,921
Whatever you do now, it's too late...
I've won.

624
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,252
The Hidden Leaf Village will be destroyed!

625
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,505
The Hidden Leaf Village
is the home where I live.

626
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,761
The Hokage exists as the pillar
to protect that home!

627
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:16,015
The Hokage is the one who inherits
and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.

628
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,226
I won't go easily!

629
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:22,522
<i>Genjutsu: Infinite Darkness Jutsu!</i>

630
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,157
<i>Stupid nonsense...</i>

631
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,326
<i>You're merely a temporary leader</i>

632
00:57:35,524 --> 00:57:38,860
<i>in the history of the organization
called the Leaf Village...</i>

633
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:51,217
<i>Even the Hokage monument you leave behind
will eventually weather and crumble.</i>

634
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:57,223
Hmph... the Hidden Leaf is more
than just an organization to me!

635
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,229
In the Leaf Village,

636
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,858
every year many shinobi
are born and raised...

637
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,112
and live and fight...
and die to protect the village.

638
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,058
The people of this village...

639
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,727
even if they don't have blood ties...

640
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,146
To me, they are precious...

641
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,734
precious...

642
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,445
family!

643
00:59:01,526 --> 00:59:08,659
<i>Then I shall smash you, the pillar,
and destroy the Leaf.</i>

644
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:15,301
Hmph! Even if you kill me,
that pillar will not break!

645
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:21,569
I am the man who carried on the will
of the First and Second Hokage...

646
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,163
The Third Hokage!

647
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:30,066
No matter how much you target
this Hidden Leaf Village...

648
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:35,863
A new Hokage will carry on my will,
become that pillar, and defend the Leaf!

649
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,284
Right, Fourth Hokage?

650
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:45,999
Orochimaru! Now I shall perform
a jutsu that even you do not know!

651
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,754
Witness it!
<i>Sealing Jutsu: Reaper Death Seal!</i>

652
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,389
<i>Must hurry...
This darkness is dangerous.</i>

653
01:00:06,117 --> 01:00:07,744
<i>I'll have you show it to me.</i>

654
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,667
<i>Please perform that jutsu, quickly.</i>

655
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,993
<i>Not yet...?</i>

656
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,537
It looks like...
I was just in time.

657
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,917
<i>What's the matter?
You're already stumbling...</i>

658
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,424
<i>Now all that's left...
is to catch them!</i>

659
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:22,929
<i>I got you!</i>

660
01:01:30,192 --> 01:01:31,902
<i>I won't let go!</i>

661
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,083
Appear!

662
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,858
<i>The darkness has disappeared...
What's this jutsu?</i>

663
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,360
I'm sorry... Sarutobi...

664
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,116
We caused you trouble...

665
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,829
Please forgive me...

666
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,496
Lord First Hokage!

667
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,332
Lord Second Hokage!

668
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,756
<i>Seal!</i>

669
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,405
Your own subordinates...!

670
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,744
Toying with even the lives
of your own subordinates...!

671
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:14,165
The lives of my subordinates?
Don't be absurd!

672
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,258
Come! Enma!

673
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,061
You're mine!

674
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,896
<i>Striking Shadow Snakes!</i>

675
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,148
Damn it! You little...!

676
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,779
It's over!

677
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,503
<i>What is this sensation...?</i>

678
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,421
<i>This is bad...</i>

679
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:16,853
- Die!
- Die!

680
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,795
Why... didn't you dodge?

681
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:51,971
There's no need to dodge.
I will die, anyway.

682
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,894
When the sealing ends,
my soul will also be devoured.

683
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,856
This is the jutsu of the hero
who once saved our village.

684
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:06,277
And now, you will also die...
by this jutsu!

685
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:12,033
So this is the jutsu that sealed
the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!

686
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:20,833
Your soul will be dragged out...
and sealed!

687
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,462
<i>My body...
I can't control it!</i>

688
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,553
You'll probably be able to see it soon.

689
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:38,947
Your soul is already
about halfway out, so...

690
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,564
Those who have their souls sealed
by this jutsu

691
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,817
will suffer inside the belly
of the Grim Reaper for eternity

692
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:50,095
and will never know peace...

693
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:56,994
Those who seal and are sealed
have their souls intertwined,

694
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:02,107
and will hate each other,
and continue to battle for eternity!

695
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,715
What...?!

696
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,848
<i>This is... the Grim Reaper?!</i>

697
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:24,438
Stop it, you old fool!
I won't let you have it your way!

698
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,417
Hurry up and... die!

699
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,060
I'll get revenge for you
no matter what...

700
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:05,930
Hayate...

701
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,152
That's the signal. Let's go!

702
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,033
Roger!

703
01:07:24,595 --> 01:07:26,346
We have to hold them off here somehow.

704
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,377
Isn't our backup here yet?!

705
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,844
<i>Ninja Art: Summoning
Bring Down the House Jutsu!</i>

706
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,358
Long time no see, Ibiki.

707
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:55,183
Jeez, is that body
the only thing that grew?!

708
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:57,139
I can't stand to look!

709
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,075
Lord Jiraiya...

710
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:01,980
Jiraiya... one of the Legendary Sannin?!

711
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:08,216
Alright, everyone! Open up those little eyes
of yours and watch closely.

712
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,598
How fortunate!

713
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:19,704
The legendary ninja Jiraiya's...
Realm of Devil's Beyond the Horizon...

714
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,351
will now rage!

715
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,358
You snakes picked a fight with
the wrong frog. Begone!

716
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:38,556
<i>So Orochimaru has finally started, eh?</i>

717
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:42,586
Where's the Third Hokage?

718
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:44,826
The Exam arena.

719
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:47,836
I see...

720
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,752
<i>Don't die... old man.</i>

721
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,549
Okay, everyone. Line up!

722
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,139
Quiet, everyone!

723
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,100
Konohamaru!

724
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,020
Konohamaru, it's not going
to collapse, is it?

725
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,314
It'll... it'll be okay.

726
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:19,155
The structure of this rock path is old,
but the construction is strong.

727
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,033
My grandpa told me so.

728
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:30,541
So it'll definitely be okay.

729
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:44,430
<i>What's this clump of smells
coming from another direction?</i>

730
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,518
Hey! Something else is tracking
Sasuke, not just us!

731
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:50,935
What?!

732
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,980
An enemy? An ally?!

733
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,066
I don't know. But...

734
01:09:56,669 --> 01:09:57,465
But?

735
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:00,863
It's not human.

736
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,280
Huh?!

737
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,364
Huh?!

738
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,462
Temari, take Gaara and go on ahead.

739
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:17,440
What?

740
01:10:18,311 --> 01:10:19,938
You're at your limit...

741
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:23,455
I don't need a hindrance.

742
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:24,532
But...!

743
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:25,732
Go!

744
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,523
Okay...

745
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,271
It can't be helped...
I'll be your opponent!

746
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,235
Hmph! I don't care who it is!

747
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,403
No!

748
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,405
Your opponent is me!

749
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:48,999
You...!

750
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,080
Shino?

751
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,124
Why are you here?!

752
01:10:57,231 --> 01:11:01,569
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena.

753
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,544
The females have almost no smell...

754
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:11,809
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.

755
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:15,545
Though the male itself
has a strong smell...

756
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:23,885
Sasuke Uchiha, go after Gaara.

757
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:29,159
Because your battle with him
hasn't been settled yet.

758
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:38,711
I'll fight him, because originally
I was his opponent...

759
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,965
You're very confident.
But are you going to be okay?

760
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,134
No need to worry.

761
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,694
Give me ten minutes, 
and I'll come back you up.

762
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,850
Hmph. I'll be done by then.

763
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,740
None of you know anything at all.

764
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:13,912
You probably don't know
of the true terror of this world.

765
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:22,087
In that case... are you going
to teach me about this "terror"?

766
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:25,923
No...

767
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,554
If you defeat me and go after Gaara,
you'll be forced to learn.

768
01:12:31,508 --> 01:12:34,135
That is, only if you can defeat me.

769
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,973
I'm from the Aburame Clan
of the Leaf Village...

770
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:19,578
When we fight,
we never underestimate our opponent,

771
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:21,246
no matter how puny an insect
might seem.

772
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,431
I will engage you with full strength!

773
01:13:23,906 --> 01:13:24,906
Bring it!

774
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,711
Put me down, Temari.

775
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,713
Can you move, Gaara?

776
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:52,718
Gaara!

777
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,727
<i>Kankuro is stalling Uchiha now.</i>

778
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,684
<i>We must use this opening...</i>

779
01:14:06,114 --> 01:14:08,158
<i>If we don't get a move on,
the operation will...</i>

780
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,445
Huh?!

781
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:13,383
Temari, go over there.

782
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,074
What?

783
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,497
Just beat it! You're in the way!

784
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,624
<i>Poison on the blade!</i>

785
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,347
<i>That's... Sasuke Uchiha!
Did he get past Kankuro?!</i>

786
01:15:18,964 --> 01:15:21,258
<i>No... No matter how you look at it,
it's too soon.</i>

787
01:15:22,328 --> 01:15:23,862
<i>Has another assailant come?</i>

788
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,689
I don't know what you Sand Shinobi
are plotting...

789
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,651
but I'll stop you!

790
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:33,819
And...

791
01:15:40,322 --> 01:15:42,772
I'll ascertain your true identity!

792
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,122
Gaara!

793
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,006
<i>Don't tell me...!</i>

794
01:15:54,234 --> 01:15:56,991
<i>Is he going to rouse that thing
in a place like this?!</i>

795
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,330
<i>This is no joke...
It's out of my hands.</i>

796
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,767
Stop, Gaara!
Have you forgotten the operation?!

797
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,980
You who are strong...
You who are called Uchiha...

798
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,148
You who have friends...

799
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:12,521
You who have a purpose...

800
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:16,863
You who are like... me!

801
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,967
You're... my...

802
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:42,536
My prey!

803
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,645
<i>It's started...!</i>

804
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,235
You're naive.

805
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:02,908
All right!

806
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,333
<i>Insects?!</i>

807
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,054
To think you'd make
a clone out of insects and

808
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:17,748
have it circle around behind me...

809
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,008
Not bad!

810
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:23,055
Your reach encompasses from medium
to long distance and you use a puppet.

811
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:25,325
I didn't think you would
do well in close combat.

812
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,894
You're well aware of a
puppet master's weaknesses!

813
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,838
However, from here on,

814
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:34,939
I'll show you the true essence of
this puppet fighting style!

815
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,113
The true terror of my puppet, Karasu!

816
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,874
<i>This is poison smoke!</i>

817
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:58,298
<i>Did I inhale... a little bit?</i>

818
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:03,303
<i>I see...
So the puppet master stays hidden, eh?</i>

819
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,610
Listen, everyone...

820
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,824
Even if enemy shinobi appear,
don't panic.

821
01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:25,870
Go into the hidden room quickly.

822
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:34,167
Your Jonin and Chunin-sensei will protect
you, even if it costs us our lives!

823
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:45,596
Oh!

824
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,389
Konohamaru...

825
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,391
It'll be okay!

826
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,727
Everyone's doing their best.

827
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,604
They'll drive off the enemy in no time.

828
01:19:05,464 --> 01:19:07,814
Cracks in the Hokage Monument...

829
01:19:08,425 --> 01:19:10,093
<i>How ominous...</i>

830
01:19:24,282 --> 01:19:27,111
Now... Let me feel it!

831
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,139
<i>That eye!</i>

832
01:19:32,972 --> 01:19:35,350
<i>That eye... from before!</i>

833
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:18,980
<i>It doesn't look like this will be
over by the time you get here...</i>

834
01:20:19,722 --> 01:20:20,722
<i>Shino...</i>

835
01:20:27,169 --> 01:20:29,713
<i>It seems the poison has
started to spread.</i>

836
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,410
<i>I'll finish this!</i>

837
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,776
<i>Insects, again?!</i>

838
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,091
<i>But he shouldn't be able to
move in that state...</i>

839
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,874
<i>I'll make things easier for you...</i>

840
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,018
<i>Hey! What's wrong?!</i>

841
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,344
<i>What's happening...?</i>

842
01:21:05,968 --> 01:21:08,763
<i>He jammed beetles into its joints
so the puppet can't move?</i>

843
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:12,075
<i>That was his aim from the beginning!</i>

844
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,787
<i>The beetles are passing through
the threads of my chakra...</i>

845
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:17,746
<i>Why...?</i>

846
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:22,377
<i>That's right! I remember now,
their food source is chakra.</i>

847
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,843
<i>At this rate,
they'll pinpoint my location!</i>

848
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,558
<i>He cut the chakra threads himself...?</i>

849
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,945
<i>You got careless!</i>

850
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:53,325
<i>Instantly reattaching chakra threads</i>

851
01:21:53,954 --> 01:21:57,290
<i>is child's play for a
first-rate puppet master.</i>

852
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,042
<i>It's a big mistake if you think
this has ended...</i>

853
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,294
<i>by simply immobilizing my puppet!</i>

854
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,672
<i>There's lots of poison
on the tip of the needle...</i>

855
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:09,673
<i>Die!</i>

856
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,807
<i>Just like that, the insects...!</i>

857
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,894
<i>The chakra threads have been
bitten through!</i>

858
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,284
What?! Why...?!

859
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,454
Where did these insects
spring out from?!

860
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,215
When you swatted away the decoy
insects on the chakra threads,

861
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:45,392
you let your guard down.

862
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:50,799
You didn't notice...
the wriggling insects behind you.

863
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,804
The insects were moving
the whole time...

864
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,474
heading for your headband.

865
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,643
W-What did you say?!

866
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:03,470
The one blow earlier...

867
01:23:03,995 --> 01:23:09,083
I pretended to miss and
attached one of my kikaichu to you.

868
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:12,821
Then, this one beetle on my forehead...

869
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,949
Right... It's a female.

870
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:29,337
<i>The poison has circulated
through my whole body, huh...</i>

871
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,550
<i>It looks like I won't be able
to back you up...</i>

872
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,804
<i>I'm sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.</i>

873
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,894
No escape!

874
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:50,191
I won't let you escape!
Sasuke Uchiha!

875
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,590
<i>You've gotta be kidding!
What's with that outrageous strength...?</i>

876
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,010
Are you afraid of me?

877
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,554
<i>It's too overwhelming...</i>

878
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:28,480
Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of my existence?!

879
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:31,331
Your hatred and intent to kill...

880
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,152
have they given way to fear?

881
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:38,501
Is that the extent of your existence?!

882
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:42,736
Fight me... and confirm it!

883
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:46,956
Your value! Your existence!

884
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,042
Experience it!

885
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,419
If you want an answer...

886
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:53,963
Come at me!

887
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:21,282
Now, let me have some fun...
Sasuke Uchiha!

888
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,912
<i>I'll finish it with one blow!</i>

889
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:43,345
Gaara!

890
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:15,628
I just realized the reason...
why it's so fun!

891
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,548
This pain...

892
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,677
To take down an opponent
who wounded me...

893
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,388
and utterly destroy him...!

894
01:26:25,726 --> 01:26:29,438
That will make me truly feel alive!

895
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:36,138
<i>Gaara's never been wounded before,
but he got him twice.</i>

896
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:40,111
<i>Is he... a freak?!</i>

897
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,199
<i>No... the true freak is...</i>

898
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,830
<i>At least Gaara has only 
transformed his right arm so far.</i>

899
01:26:54,555 --> 01:26:56,474
More, more!

900
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:57,794
<i>What?!</i>

901
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,017
<i>What the heck is this guy?!</i>

902
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,186
<i>One after another...</i>

903
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,108
Here goes!

904
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:21,902
<i>He's even faster!</i>

905
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,751
<i>I can't dodge unless
I read ahead of his movements.</i>

906
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:40,004
<i>If I didn't have these eyes
I'd have died long ago.</i>

907
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:45,750
<i>I can't use Chidori again...</i>

908
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,806
<i>Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!</i>

909
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,947
<i>So Fire Style doesn't
work against sand...</i>

910
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,318
<i>Not only that,
this level of jutsu won't...</i>

911
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,487
Die!

912
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,864
<i>Apparently... only the Chidori will...</i>

913
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:32,348
Well, your limit is two shots a day.
That's all you've got for now.

914
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,512
This is as many Chidori
you can shoot in one day

915
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:39,832
with your current chakra levels.

916
01:28:40,832 --> 01:28:43,835
After all, this Chidori is a technique
that can only be used

917
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,060
in conjunction with the Sharingan
in actual combat.

918
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:51,701
But using the Sharingan and
another jutsu simultaneously means

919
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,414
exploding and using up the chakra
in your body all at once.

920
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:01,085
Still, you're one of the more
impressive ones I've trained.

921
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,046
Even with my Chidori...

922
01:29:03,477 --> 01:29:06,229
If I use the Lightning Blade
four times in a day,

923
01:29:06,673 --> 01:29:09,175
I'd completely use up my chakra.

924
01:29:10,587 --> 01:29:14,133
What would happen if I tried
to use more than two shots?

925
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:17,628
The third shot won't be activated...

926
01:29:18,672 --> 01:29:19,840
Remember this well!

927
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:23,710
If you try to force a jutsu to activate...

928
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,319
not only will the jutsu
not properly activate,

929
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,336
but your chakra will deplete to zero...

930
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,240
And in the worst case, you'll die!

931
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:39,019
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.

932
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,668
Especially in your case.

933
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,470
What's the matter?

934
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,474
Does the value of your existence
amount to only this much?

935
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,851
I'll be blunt...

936
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,230
You are... weak!

937
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,569
You're too optimistic.

938
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:11,578
And it's because your hatred
is weak!

939
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,286
The power of hatred is
the power of the intent to kill!

940
01:30:18,155 --> 01:30:21,283
The power of the intent to kill
is the power of revenge!

941
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,291
Shut up...

942
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,588
Do you understand
the meaning of this?!

943
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:29,464
Shut up!

944
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:34,879
That means...
You're weaker than I am!

945
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:42,687
<i>Itachi chose me to be the avenger...
to have me kill him!</i>

946
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:47,442
<i>I am an avenger!</i>

947
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:43,539
<i>The Curse Mark again...</i>

948
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,299
<i>Damn...! My body...</i>

949
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,738
<i>T-This guy...</i>

950
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,032
Sasuke!

951
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,487
You guys...

952
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,040
<i>T-This...</i>

953
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,669
<i>He probably fought recklessly...</i>

954
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,547
<i>like that time!</i>

955
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:37,008
Sasuke!

956
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:41,055
<i>Kakashi-sensei said there was nothing
to worry about with that mark!</i>

957
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,432
So tell me... Sakura...

958
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:45,517
Sakura!

959
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,471
What do you want?!

960
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:51,065
This guy... Who is he?!

961
01:32:52,191 --> 01:32:54,610
His outward appearance
is different, but...

962
01:32:55,918 --> 01:32:57,837
he's that guy called Gaara.

963
01:32:59,626 --> 01:33:02,170
<i>I was born a monster.</i>

964
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:06,163
<i>So that's what he was saying...</i>

965
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:09,250
<i>He's the one who hurt Sasuke...</i>

966
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:10,753
Hey young girl!

967
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:14,797
Just so you know,
I'm not the fighting type!

968
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:16,679
I know that just by looking at you!

969
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:19,844
Sasuke!

970
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,888
I see...

971
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,434
you're the one I failed to kill back then.

972
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:32,189
L-Let's run! Everyone!

973
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,610
Die, Sasuke Uchiha!

974
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:41,782
Out of the way!

975
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:57,798
Sakura!

976
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:10,227
Why...?

977
01:34:28,226 --> 01:34:29,226
Mommy...

978
01:34:41,464 --> 01:34:42,465
I...

979
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:47,765
I...

980
01:35:25,456 --> 01:35:27,842
Hey, you're so cool!

981
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:38,977
Wow!

982
01:35:40,561 --> 01:35:43,253
Can you do food too?

983
01:35:54,718 --> 01:35:56,178
Whoa, grilled squid!

984
01:36:01,692 --> 01:36:02,693
Ramen!

985
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:09,690
Cherries!

986
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:13,562
Lobster!

987
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:20,118
Hmm... Sea urchin and rice bowl!

988
01:36:20,586 --> 01:36:21,683
That's so cool!

989
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:23,126
Okay then...

990
01:36:24,436 --> 01:36:25,812
How about a big pile of poop?

991
01:36:26,035 --> 01:36:27,328
Can you do it?

992
01:36:33,196 --> 01:36:33,863
Temari...

993
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:35,762
Kankuro...

994
01:36:36,455 --> 01:36:36,955
Yes!

995
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:44,423
Gaara...

996
01:36:45,161 --> 01:36:45,855
Temari!

997
01:36:46,989 --> 01:36:47,554
Yes!

998
01:37:15,721 --> 01:37:17,180
Hey, Yashamaru...

999
01:37:18,481 --> 01:37:21,651
I don't get sleepy, even at night.

1000
01:37:21,806 --> 01:37:23,224
Why is that?

1001
01:37:23,509 --> 01:37:25,094
Now, that's a problem.

1002
01:37:26,653 --> 01:37:29,989
Normally, when you close your eyes,
you get sleepy.

1003
01:37:30,302 --> 01:37:32,137
Really?

1004
01:37:33,643 --> 01:37:34,367
Hey...

1005
01:37:36,012 --> 01:37:40,684
Why... Why don't I have a mother?

1006
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:41,870
Well...

1007
01:37:44,396 --> 01:37:47,591
You have me, Lord Gaara.

1008
01:37:49,689 --> 01:37:53,192
Because I am at your side...

1009
01:37:53,482 --> 01:37:54,650
... always.

1010
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:54,345
Oh... a boxed lunch?

1011
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:55,420
Yes!

1012
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,825
Ready?

1013
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,935
Over here!

1014
01:39:05,411 --> 01:39:06,411
Power shot!

1015
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:11,946
What are we gonna do?

1016
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:16,495
We don't know how to
wall-climbing or anything...

1017
01:39:25,335 --> 01:39:26,670
Y-You're...

1018
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,427
This...

1019
01:39:35,831 --> 01:39:36,957
It's Gaara...

1020
01:39:37,246 --> 01:39:38,581
R-Run!

1021
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,146
Wait!

1022
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:48,649
Don't leave me alone!

1023
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,528
Help me!

1024
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:55,154
<i>I don't...</i>

1025
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,784
<i>want to be alone anymore!</i>

1026
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,333
<i>Really...</i>

1027
01:40:08,627 --> 01:40:09,795
No!

1028
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:18,018
Gaara! Please calm down!

1029
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:20,763
Yashamaru...

1030
01:40:36,655 --> 01:40:38,115
It's no use after all...

1031
01:40:39,145 --> 01:40:40,647
The sand gets in the way.

1032
01:40:42,414 --> 01:40:43,582
Gaara...

1033
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:45,834
Yashamaru!

1034
01:40:47,053 --> 01:40:48,763
I may not look it,

1035
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:51,707
but Lord Kazekage charged me
to look after your physical condition

1036
01:40:51,732 --> 01:40:54,152
as a member of medical corps
and as your guardian.

1037
01:40:54,942 --> 01:40:57,778
Please do not do such things
in front of me.

1038
01:41:00,326 --> 01:41:02,545
Yashamaru... I'm sorry...

1039
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:07,604
Oh, this? It's just a scrape.

1040
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:11,607
A scrape...

1041
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:13,744
Is it painful?

1042
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:19,356
A little bit...
But it'll heal in no time.

1043
01:41:22,662 --> 01:41:24,127
What is pain?

1044
01:41:26,638 --> 01:41:30,475
I've... never been wounded, so...

1045
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,757
I wondered what it's like...

1046
01:41:34,128 --> 01:41:35,380
Well...

1047
01:41:36,084 --> 01:41:38,127
How can I explain it?

1048
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:42,054
It's distressing, or difficult...

1049
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:45,887
In other words, when you're hit or cut...

1050
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,323
Maybe I should say it's a feeling
of not being able to bear it,

1051
01:41:50,447 --> 01:41:51,863
of not being able to stay normal...

1052
01:41:53,332 --> 01:41:54,833
I can't say it well,

1053
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:58,082
but I suppose it describes a situation
that's not very pleasant.

1054
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:05,410
So... maybe I'm injured too?
The same as everyone?

1055
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:08,080
I'm not bleeding, but...

1056
01:42:08,448 --> 01:42:11,055
I've been having a lot of
pain around... here.

1057
01:42:22,773 --> 01:42:25,639
Blood does flow from a wound
on the body

1058
01:42:25,664 --> 01:42:27,458
and the wound itself will be painful.

1059
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,056
But as time passes, the pain
naturally disappears.

1060
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,981
By using medicine,
the healing is even faster.

1061
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:38,262
But what's truly dangerous is
a wound to the heart.

1062
01:42:38,762 --> 01:42:41,029
That's much harder to heal.

1063
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:43,448
A wound to the heart?

1064
01:42:43,894 --> 01:42:46,994
A wound on the body and a wound
to the heart are slightly different.

1065
01:42:48,133 --> 01:42:51,348
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,

1066
01:42:51,587 --> 01:42:53,438
it might never heal
in one's entire lifetime.

1067
01:43:00,923 --> 01:43:04,437
But there is one thing that
can cure a wound to the heart.

1068
01:43:06,508 --> 01:43:08,659
However, this is a complicated medicine.

1069
01:43:09,148 --> 01:43:11,577
It can only be given to you
by another person.

1070
01:43:11,639 --> 01:43:13,891
What? What do I have to do for that...?

1071
01:43:15,065 --> 01:43:17,069
The thing that can cure
a wound to the heart.

1072
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:18,984
That is...

1073
01:43:21,919 --> 01:43:23,170
Love.

1074
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,199
Love?

1075
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:26,325
Yes.

1076
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:31,372
H-How can I get it?
What do I have to do to receive it...?

1077
01:43:31,849 --> 01:43:35,186
You've already been given it, Gaara.

1078
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:36,289
Huh?

1079
01:43:40,356 --> 01:43:44,803
Love is... the desire to serve
someone precious to you,

1080
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:49,595
to cherish them and watch over them,
just as my older sister did for you.

1081
01:43:50,466 --> 01:43:54,019
I believe that my older sister
loved you, Gaara.

1082
01:43:54,535 --> 01:43:59,623
The sand which automatically tries to
protect you is like the love of a mother.

1083
01:44:00,633 --> 01:44:05,013
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother's will.

1084
01:44:06,878 --> 01:44:12,425
My sister... likely wanted to
protect you even after death...

1085
01:44:15,784 --> 01:44:16,792
Yashamaru...

1086
01:44:17,755 --> 01:44:18,627
What is it?

1087
01:44:19,732 --> 01:44:23,819
Thanks for what you did earlier...
for stopping me.

1088
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:25,842
You're welcome.

1089
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,346
You are a precious person
who is near me, Gaara!

1090
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:45,639
<i>Can you understand... my pain?</i>

1091
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:54,537
<i>It tastes like iron...</i>

1092
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,003
<i>Hey, Yashamaru...
I have a favor to ask!</i>

1093
01:45:01,739 --> 01:45:02,739
<i>What is it?</i>

1094
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:05,638
<i>I want some ointment.</i>

1095
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:18,763
Sorry about earlier...
It must've hurt.

1096
01:45:19,356 --> 01:45:21,483
This is medicine.

1097
01:45:21,853 --> 01:45:22,687
If you want it-

1098
01:45:22,794 --> 01:45:24,796
Go home... freak!

1099
01:45:37,309 --> 01:45:40,103
<i>As I thought...
Things don't go well...</i>

1100
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:47,674
<i>Why is it... that I'm the only one
who's such a freak?!</i>

1101
01:45:49,573 --> 01:45:52,075
<i>What... am I?!</i>

1102
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:56,850
<i>The thing that can cure
a wound to the heart is love.</i>

1103
01:45:58,318 --> 01:45:59,694
<i>Yashamaru!</i>

1104
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:17,079
<i>Why? Why me...?</i>

1105
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:19,289
<i>Why is it always me?!</i>

1106
01:47:00,728 --> 01:47:03,856
Well done... Gaara.

1107
01:47:08,164 --> 01:47:10,653
W-Why...? Why would you do that?!

1108
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,301
Why Yashamaru...?

1109
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,971
Why did you, why...?

1110
01:47:18,525 --> 01:47:21,904
I was ordered to kill you...

1111
01:47:25,296 --> 01:47:26,672
By your father...

1112
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:29,498
Lord Kazekage.

1113
01:47:32,904 --> 01:47:34,030
My father...?

1114
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:44,833
Why did my father...?

1115
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:46,418
Why...? Why me?

1116
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:51,423
You have been watched over
as an experiment.

1117
01:47:53,863 --> 01:47:58,071
Gaara, you couldn't
control the Shukaku...

1118
01:47:58,096 --> 01:48:01,766
a spirit that commands
the power of sand.

1119
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:06,980
Eventually, your existence would
become too dangerous for the village.

1120
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,942
Before that occurred...

1121
01:48:14,112 --> 01:48:16,364
So Yashamaru, you had no choice...

1122
01:48:16,948 --> 01:48:18,658
you just had to follow my father's order...?

1123
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:22,954
No... That is not correct.

1124
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:28,197
It is true I accepted
Lord Kazekage's order.

1125
01:48:29,255 --> 01:48:33,092
But if I had wanted to,
I could have turned it down.

1126
01:48:36,218 --> 01:48:37,218
Gaara...

1127
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:42,911
Deep down in my heart,
I probably...

1128
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:45,685
hated you.

1129
01:48:47,257 --> 01:48:50,009
You, who took the life
of my beloved sister at birth.

1130
01:48:50,744 --> 01:48:52,615
You are the child she left behind...

1131
01:48:53,726 --> 01:49:00,191
Since you were what she left behind,
I tried desperately to love you.

1132
01:49:00,995 --> 01:49:03,456
But... I never could.

1133
01:49:04,775 --> 01:49:07,806
My sister didn't choose to have you.

1134
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:11,377
My sister became a sacrifice
for the village,

1135
01:49:11,589 --> 01:49:13,924
and she died while
cursing this village!

1136
01:49:15,643 --> 01:49:17,312
Since then, I probably...

1137
01:49:17,842 --> 01:49:21,513
have carried a wound
in my heart that would never heal.

1138
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:25,600
Your name...
is the name my sister gave you.

1139
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:30,814
"This child's name is Gaara..."

1140
01:49:31,606 --> 01:49:33,316
"A demon who loves only himself..."

1141
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:35,485
"Love only yourself..."

1142
01:49:36,486 --> 01:49:39,447
"And fight only for
your own sake."

1143
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:43,326
"If you do that,
you will continue to exist."

1144
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:45,993
Such was the hope it contained.

1145
01:49:46,647 --> 01:49:47,647
However...

1146
01:49:47,837 --> 01:49:50,089
my sister did not give you this name

1147
01:49:50,114 --> 01:49:52,866
because she was concerned
about you or loved you...

1148
01:49:53,271 --> 01:49:57,567
The reason she gave you this name...

1149
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:02,012
... was so that the deep-seated hatred
of my sister

1150
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:05,062
who died hating and cursing
this village...

1151
01:50:06,745 --> 01:50:08,788
would remain...

1152
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:13,273
and be known to all!

1153
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,119
You were never... loved!

1154
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:42,636
Please die...

1155
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:07,035
<i>I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.</i>

1156
01:51:08,119 --> 01:51:09,204
<i>Love?</i>

1157
01:51:54,066 --> 01:51:56,235
<i>Love only yourself.</i>

1158
01:51:56,598 --> 01:52:00,227
<i>And fight only for your own sake.</i>

1159
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:04,134
<i>So that is Gaara...
That is me.</i>

1160
01:52:04,884 --> 01:52:06,386
<i>I finally understand.</i>

1161
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:09,806
<i>I am alone.</i>

1162
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:13,893
<i>I will no longer believe in anyone...
or love anyone.</i>

1163
01:52:15,603 --> 01:52:16,896
<i>I am alone!</i>

1164
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:24,988
<i>Yes, I am all by myself.</i>

1165
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:33,163
<i>It's those eyes...</i>

1166
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:40,128
What's the matter?
Weren't you gonna run away?

1167
01:52:42,338 --> 01:52:43,423
Sasuke...

1168
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:46,676
Naruto...

1169
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:56,230
What are these two... to you?!

1170
01:52:58,295 --> 01:53:01,691
T-These two are... my friends!

1171
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:05,111
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!

1172
01:53:05,615 --> 01:53:07,513
I'll knock you out!

1173
01:53:13,995 --> 01:53:17,999
So... what's the matter?!
Weren't you going to knock me out?

1174
01:53:21,049 --> 01:53:22,309
Hurry up and come at me...

1175
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:31,596
Damn it!

1176
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:40,146
Damn it!

1177
01:53:48,029 --> 01:53:51,658
<i>Damn it! Things will get really bad
if they stay like this...!</i>

1178
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:56,495
<i>I'll have to...</i>

1179
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:01,125
<i>It's come to this...
Though it's gonna use a lot of chakra...</i>

1180
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:06,714
<i>There's no other way...
I have to summon Gamabunta!</i>

1181
01:54:07,215 --> 01:54:08,675
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1182
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:15,265
What's this?! You're a little kid!

1183
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:17,814
If you want something from me,
give me some snack!

1184
01:54:18,175 --> 01:54:20,662
If you don't, I won't play with you!

1185
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:24,207
You know something?
I hate frogs!

1186
01:54:24,232 --> 01:54:27,485
What did you say?!
Don't make fun of amphibians! Really!

1187
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:32,157
Jeez, I don't have time to
play with you, little squirt!

1188
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,619
<i>Damn! Why is it...?</i>

1189
01:54:36,817 --> 01:54:40,321
<i>I practiced for so long, but if  this is
all I can summon, there's no other way...</i>

1190
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:43,167
I need to save everyone!

1191
01:54:44,935 --> 01:54:46,821
Everyone... you say?

1192
01:54:47,171 --> 01:54:48,464
Don't make me laugh.

1193
01:54:48,923 --> 01:54:51,843
I fight... only for myself!

1194
01:54:57,181 --> 01:54:59,642
<i>He... he's transforming again!</i>

1195
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:07,275
If you don't take me down,
the sand holding this girl will remain!

1196
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,143
Not only that, as time passes...

1197
01:55:11,168 --> 01:55:14,588
the sand will slowly squeeze tighter
and eventually suffocate this girl!

1198
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:16,829
<i>Sakura!</i>

1199
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:20,413
<i>He's getting closer and closer
to a full transformation.</i>

1200
01:55:21,568 --> 01:55:23,779
<i>That jutsu hasn't been activated yet,</i>

1201
01:55:24,125 --> 01:55:25,835
<i>but at this rate, I'll also be...!</i>

1202
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:28,087
<i>Sand Shuriken!</i>

1203
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:39,057
You're... really weak!

1204
01:55:39,864 --> 01:55:40,665
Shut up!

1205
01:55:40,999 --> 01:55:42,757
Just what is that guy?

1206
01:55:52,609 --> 01:55:54,653
<i>W-What lonely eyes...</i>

1207
01:55:55,093 --> 01:55:57,095
<i>I don't know what happened, but...</i>

1208
01:55:57,957 --> 01:56:01,127
<i>This guy's always been
suffering all alone...</i>

1209
01:56:01,864 --> 01:56:03,532
<i>Even now,
without ever feeling relief...</i>

1210
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:07,210
<i>Only able to believe in himself...</i>

1211
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:10,454
<i>Even now,
he's battling in hell...</i>

1212
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:16,719
What's the matter?!
Are you afraid of me?

1213
01:56:17,091 --> 01:56:20,970
Fighting for yourself?
Fighting for others?

1214
01:56:21,536 --> 01:56:26,041
You should just love yourself,
and fight for yourself!

1215
01:56:26,573 --> 01:56:29,826
That's what it means to be strong!

1216
01:56:31,167 --> 01:56:32,710
Now fight me!

1217
01:56:33,077 --> 01:56:34,995
What happened to
the boldness you had earlier?!

1218
01:56:35,416 --> 01:56:39,879
Show me your strength!
I'll crush that strength underfoot!

1219
01:56:42,034 --> 01:56:46,538
Now what's the matter?!
If you don't fight me I'll kill that girl!

1220
01:56:49,564 --> 01:56:51,024
Damn it!

1221
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:54,065
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1222
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,386
<i>Wind Style:</i>

1223
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:03,433
<i>Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!</i>

1224
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:11,065
<i>This isn't good...
He really got me.</i>

1225
01:57:11,441 --> 01:57:14,318
First, I'll toy with you
without killing you!

1226
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:17,196
I look forward to seeing
when and how you give up

1227
01:57:17,221 --> 01:57:18,806
and abandon your precious friends!

1228
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:28,124
<i>But... what is it?</i>

1229
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,919
It's far from over!

1230
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:41,262
<i>What is this... this feeling?</i>

1231
01:57:42,263 --> 01:57:43,598
<i>Sand Shuriken!</i>

1232
01:57:50,271 --> 01:57:52,982
D-Damn it!

1233
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:55,234
Damn it!

1234
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:57,445
H-He's...

1235
01:57:58,446 --> 01:58:02,533
<i>What is this?!
This feeling that's overcoming me?</i>

1236
01:58:04,846 --> 01:58:07,641
<i>For some reason...
I don't want to lose to this guy...</i>

1237
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:09,754
You...

1238
01:58:13,011 --> 01:58:14,943
<i>... even if I die!</i>

1239
01:58:15,379 --> 01:58:16,506
What's the matter?

1240
01:58:17,006 --> 01:58:19,675
After pursuing me like that,
what's up with you?

1241
01:58:20,127 --> 01:58:22,958
You're not even able to touch me...

1242
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:25,056
What a joke!

1243
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:28,183
<i>Sakura...</i>

1244
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:35,024
<i>I don't know how far I can go, but...</i>

1245
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:39,695
I have to give it... my best shot!

1246
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:41,280
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1247
01:58:47,078 --> 01:58:48,246
Here goes!

1248
01:58:48,412 --> 01:58:50,915
This is my ultimate secret taijutsu!

1249
01:58:51,207 --> 01:58:55,294
Naruto Uzumaki...
Clone Body Slam!

1250
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:01,509
- Now!
- Now!

1251
01:59:01,634 --> 01:59:02,760
Okay!

1252
01:59:04,846 --> 01:59:06,472
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1253
01:59:07,765 --> 01:59:10,768
Once again...
<i>Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1254
01:59:12,603 --> 01:59:13,396
Take this!

1255
01:59:13,437 --> 01:59:15,606
Hidden Leaf Secret Ultimate
Taijutsu Technique,

1256
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:17,150
learned from Kakashi-sensei!

1257
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:20,611
<i>A Thousand Years of Death!</i>

1258
01:59:26,242 --> 01:59:27,121
Gotcha.

1259
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:40,631
Doing all that work...
And managing just one blow, huh?

1260
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:43,092
S-Shut up!

1261
01:59:45,219 --> 01:59:49,515
<i>He attacked the base of the tail
which has the weakest defense...</i>

1262
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:53,967
<i>Even though I'm not wounded,
I can't absorb the impact.</i>

1263
01:59:55,813 --> 01:59:57,315
<i>Did I underestimate him too much?</i>

1264
02:00:01,527 --> 02:00:02,737
Hey, Naruto...

1265
02:00:04,262 --> 02:00:07,766
Sakura... Rescue her,
even if it's the last thing you do!

1266
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:10,608
And after you've rescued her...

1267
02:00:11,743 --> 02:00:13,620
take Sakura and get out of here.

1268
02:00:15,082 --> 02:00:16,292
You, if anyone, can do it!

1269
02:00:18,912 --> 02:00:23,166
I can still... hold him off for a while.

1270
02:00:25,801 --> 02:00:28,346
I lost everything once...

1271
02:00:29,267 --> 02:00:31,937
I don't want to see...

1272
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:36,187
any precious comrades die
right before my eyes again.

1273
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:40,233
Precious... comrades...

1274
02:00:41,734 --> 02:00:42,985
<i>I will not allow my comrades...</i>

1275
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:46,614
<i>to be killed, no matter what.</i>

1276
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:53,411
I see...

1277
02:00:57,866 --> 02:00:59,273
That's right.

1278
02:01:01,645 --> 02:01:03,522
Because he has gone through life

1279
02:01:03,547 --> 02:01:06,092
with the same loneliness
and sadness as I have...

1280
02:01:06,634 --> 02:01:11,389
That guy who continued to fight
in solitude for himself,

1281
02:01:11,497 --> 02:01:13,598
I thought... he was strong.

1282
02:01:15,726 --> 02:01:16,727
Naruto...

1283
02:01:17,186 --> 02:01:21,774
But that's not what true strength is...

1284
02:01:22,441 --> 02:01:24,735
If one fights just for
oneself in solitude...

1285
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:27,780
one can't really become strong...

1286
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:34,477
<i>When a person has something
precious they want to protect...</i>

1287
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:42,171
<i>that's when... they can truly
become strong.</i>

1288
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:50,594
<i>You will... become strong.</i>

1289
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,686
<i>He's releasing such a
massive amount of chakra!</i>

1290
02:02:00,062 --> 02:02:02,356
<i>That's... Naruto?!</i>

1291
02:02:04,532 --> 02:02:06,660
No matter what, I will...

1292
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:12,033
protect you!

1293
02:02:21,375 --> 02:02:23,377
<i>Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!</i>

1294
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:32,428
I've kept you waiting
a long time!

1295
02:02:33,304 --> 02:02:37,016
The First Scroll of the Naruto Uzumaki
Ninja Chronicles begins now!

1296
02:02:37,266 --> 02:02:40,978
W-What's up with this...
large number of clones?!

1297
02:02:41,562 --> 02:02:42,980
What the heck is this?

1298
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:46,734
T-This is... amazing!

1299
02:02:47,985 --> 02:02:51,072
You are pretty promising.

1300
02:02:51,572 --> 02:02:53,532
You... This is...

1301
02:02:53,949 --> 02:02:57,161
Sasuke, you get yourself
a good rest.

1302
02:02:57,828 --> 02:03:01,415
Leave the rest to Naruto Uzumaki!

1303
02:03:03,686 --> 02:03:04,686
<i>This guy is...</i>

1304
02:03:05,836 --> 02:03:09,507
Alright, everyone! Here we go!

1305
02:03:10,788 --> 02:03:13,333
<i>That's Naruto?!</i>

1306
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:19,809
Jump!

1307
02:03:20,684 --> 02:03:23,854
Naruto's... Ninja... Handbook!

1308
02:03:27,108 --> 02:03:28,526
Everywhere...

1309
02:03:28,734 --> 02:03:30,403
Shuriken!

1310
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:33,322
<i>My body hasn't fully recovered...</i>

1311
02:03:33,364 --> 02:03:35,491
<i>My only choice is to
use Sand as a defense!</i>

1312
02:03:41,122 --> 02:03:46,001
- U-zu-ma-ki... Naruto Two Thousand Combo!
- U-zu-ma-ki... Naruto Two Thousand Combo!

1313
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:01,350
- Barrage!
- Barrage!

1314
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:09,608
<i>T-This guy...!</i>

1315
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,545
- This time, I'll use both legs...
- This time, I'll use both legs...

1316
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:13,654
- and make it a Four Thousand Hit Barrage!
- And make it a Four Thousand Hit Barrage!

1317
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,283
<i>Where does that strength come from?</i>

1318
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:22,121
<i>No way!
There's no way...</i>

1319
02:04:24,419 --> 02:04:29,507
<i>No way I'll... lose to... a guy like this!</i>

1320
02:04:41,765 --> 02:04:43,642
W-What's... that?

1321
02:04:51,108 --> 02:04:53,486
<i>It finally... emerged.</i>

1322
02:05:10,294 --> 02:05:11,587
<i>He's fully transformed!</i>

1323
02:05:16,133 --> 02:05:20,387
This is...
the monster inside that guy.

1324
02:05:25,017 --> 02:05:26,017
Naruto!

1325
02:05:28,437 --> 02:05:30,397
Damn... my body!

1326
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:35,694
<i>My chakra is almost gone...
from all those clones earlier...</i>

1327
02:05:41,784 --> 02:05:42,515
<i>Sakura!</i>

1328
02:05:47,414 --> 02:05:49,333
This will mark your end...

1329
02:05:49,989 --> 02:05:51,135
<i>Sand Burial!</i>

1330
02:05:51,159 --> 02:05:52,408
<i>Summoning Jutsu!</i>

1331
02:06:00,386 --> 02:06:01,637
I will protect...

1332
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,723
Sakura!

1333
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:12,398
Naruto Uzumaki...

1334
02:06:15,943 --> 02:06:19,989
You continue to provide
such exquisite entertainment...

1335
02:06:20,489 --> 02:06:24,577
<i>Naruto...
What in the... world...?</i>

1336
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:28,539
Not you again!
What in the world do you want?

1337
02:06:29,582 --> 02:06:30,582
Huh?!

1338
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:35,671
That must be...
the Shukaku of the Sand.

1339
02:06:36,505 --> 02:06:40,050
Boss Toad!
You gotta help me fight!

1340
02:06:44,513 --> 02:06:45,514
No way!

1341
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:46,724
What?!

1342
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:50,936
Why would I go out of my way
and fight a guy like that?

1343
02:06:51,434 --> 02:06:53,061
That's idiotic!

1344
02:06:53,188 --> 02:06:54,523
Why?!

1345
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:57,610
You told me the other day that you
would make me your henchman!

1346
02:06:57,860 --> 02:07:01,030
It's a boss's duty to help out
his underling!

1347
02:07:01,363 --> 02:07:03,198
That's respect and duty, right?!

1348
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:07,578
It's true I told you
I'd make you my henchman...

1349
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:12,708
But we haven't even exchanged cups
of sake to seal our relationship yet...

1350
02:07:12,791 --> 02:07:16,378
Gimme a break!
I'm still underage!

1351
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:18,047
I can't drink alcohol!

1352
02:07:19,055 --> 02:07:22,517
Don't say that and just listen
to what this guy says, Pop!

1353
02:07:22,593 --> 02:07:23,855
Huh?! Pop?!

1354
02:07:24,595 --> 02:07:28,432
Why are you here, Gamakichi?

1355
02:07:28,668 --> 02:07:31,046
I had lots of time on my hands,
so I came to visit...

1356
02:07:31,685 --> 02:07:34,063
Huh? Huh?
You're father and son?

1357
02:07:34,614 --> 02:07:37,450
And that guy over there
tried to bully me!

1358
02:07:38,771 --> 02:07:40,648
What was that?!

1359
02:07:41,445 --> 02:07:44,573
When that happened,
this guy here rescued me...

1360
02:07:44,995 --> 02:07:47,206
He clashed with that monster...

1361
02:07:47,242 --> 02:07:50,037
Pretty interesting guy.

1362
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,707
I see...

1363
02:07:54,958 --> 02:07:59,254
Kid...
I recognize you as my henchman...

1364
02:08:00,172 --> 02:08:04,885
and I'll show you what duty
and respect means!

1365
02:08:07,888 --> 02:08:10,099
Hang on tight!

1366
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:14,936
How's that?!

1367
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,444
<i>Awesome...</i>

1368
02:08:38,085 --> 02:08:39,920
<i>What a guy...</i>

1369
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:41,422
<i>He's so heavy,</i>

1370
02:08:41,447 --> 02:08:43,657
<i>I could barely manage to
thrust my dagger through him.</i>

1371
02:08:44,378 --> 02:08:45,963
<i>If I don't hurry up,</i>

1372
02:08:46,016 --> 02:08:48,227
<i>this battle will change
the shape of the landscape.</i>

1373
02:08:49,085 --> 02:08:50,878
Hey! Hey! Boss!

1374
02:08:51,056 --> 02:08:54,268
Sakura is over that way,
so don't move that way!

1375
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:56,720
Please lure him in this direction.

1376
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:58,787
Sakura...?

1377
02:08:59,356 --> 02:09:01,942
That's his girlfriend, Pop.

1378
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:04,069
I've got to take that guy down.

1379
02:09:04,614 --> 02:09:06,616
Otherwise, I won't be able
to rescue Sakura!

1380
02:09:10,075 --> 02:09:11,577
Interesting!

1381
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:16,248
This is interesting, Naruto Uzumaki!

1382
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:17,583
<i>T-This isn't good!</i>

1383
02:09:18,375 --> 02:09:20,711
<i>Gaara...
He's going to do it...</i>

1384
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:22,421
<i>I need to get out of here!</i>

1385
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:44,067
He's done it...!

1386
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:48,322
W-What's gonna happen, Chief?

1387
02:09:49,531 --> 02:09:52,951
When the host uses the Feigning Sleep Jutsu...

1388
02:09:52,976 --> 02:09:55,311
... Shukaku will appear!

1389
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:06,089
I'm finally able to emerge!

1390
02:10:08,342 --> 02:10:13,305
Let's do this!
The guy I wanna kill is you!

1391
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,682
I'm gonna jump...

1392
02:10:16,016 --> 02:10:16,558
Huh?

1393
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:19,937
<i>Wind Style: Air Bullets!</i>

1394
02:10:22,773 --> 02:10:25,192
<i>Water Style: Water Bullets!</i>

1395
02:10:34,326 --> 02:10:36,995
That practically created a storm...

1396
02:10:37,746 --> 02:10:40,040
What kind of battle is this...?!

1397
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:45,712
Chief! I told you,
not in that direction!

1398
02:10:45,836 --> 02:10:48,672
Shut up! I know!

1399
02:10:50,384 --> 02:10:51,885
<i>Air Bullets!</i>

1400
02:10:52,886 --> 02:10:54,054
<i>Water Bullets!</i>

1401
02:10:57,766 --> 02:10:59,059
Too bad...

1402
02:10:59,393 --> 02:11:01,313
This isn't good, Chief!
There's one shot left...!

1403
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,239
Yeah! I killed it...

1404
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:13,907
I killed it!

1405
02:11:17,911 --> 02:11:20,080
That hurts...!

1406
02:11:20,711 --> 02:11:22,254
How dare you shoot me

1407
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:24,666
with bullets containing
stupid amounts of chakra!

1408
02:11:25,586 --> 02:11:29,214
Even I can't take that many shots!

1409
02:11:29,339 --> 02:11:31,091
What should we do?!

1410
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:36,263
For a start,
wake up the host, kid!

1411
02:11:36,763 --> 02:11:38,015
That'll break the jutsu!

1412
02:11:38,098 --> 02:11:39,683
How do we go about waking him?!

1413
02:11:39,708 --> 02:11:42,628
Give him a good punch!

1414
02:11:43,687 --> 02:11:44,980
<i>Water Bullets!</i>

1415
02:11:45,647 --> 02:11:47,316
Like I'll take that!

1416
02:11:53,697 --> 02:11:57,576
Chief, I can't hit him
unless you hold him down!

1417
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:04,333
This Toad doesn't have fangs or claws
to restrain that guy.

1418
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:07,085
What should we do then?!

1419
02:12:07,451 --> 02:12:11,580
We'll use the Transformation Jutsu
and change into something that does!

1420
02:12:13,467 --> 02:12:14,509
But with that said...

1421
02:12:14,535 --> 02:12:17,413
I'm not particularly good
at transformations.

1422
02:12:17,512 --> 02:12:18,180
Huh?

1423
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:23,393
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!

1424
02:12:23,477 --> 02:12:24,686
Whaaaat?!

1425
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:26,605
Time for a combined transformation!

1426
02:12:26,772 --> 02:12:28,106
Uh... Okay!

1427
02:12:28,815 --> 02:12:31,526
We got to have fangs and claws!

1428
02:12:31,818 --> 02:12:33,320
Umm...

1429
02:12:33,695 --> 02:12:35,489
Let's go!

1430
02:12:36,406 --> 02:12:38,784
Wait...
Say, w-wait a second...!

1431
02:12:39,826 --> 02:12:42,287
F-Fangs and claws... Fangs and claws...
Fangs and claws!

1432
02:12:44,081 --> 02:12:46,416
<i>Transform!</i>

1433
02:12:54,904 --> 02:12:55,749
That's the...!

1434
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:09,898
All right! Now!

1435
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:10,940
Okay!

1436
02:13:13,735 --> 02:13:15,195
Wake the hell up!

1437
02:13:20,575 --> 02:13:21,910
You jerk...

1438
02:13:22,713 --> 02:13:23,684
<i>All right!</i>

1439
02:13:23,912 --> 02:13:26,707
<i>Not that much time has passed
since the host went to sleep!</i>

1440
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:29,876
<i>In that state,
one blow should be enough!</i>

1441
02:13:32,379 --> 02:13:34,006
Damn it!

1442
02:13:34,089 --> 02:13:37,467
I just got here!

1443
02:13:48,937 --> 02:13:51,523
<i>That guy interfered with my jutsu...?!</i>

1444
02:13:54,484 --> 02:13:56,319
<i>Sand Coffin!</i>

1445
02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:58,488
- Pop!
- Yeah!

1446
02:13:59,281 --> 02:14:00,866
Don't take me for a fool!

1447
02:14:11,752 --> 02:14:12,753
<i>Damn!</i>

1448
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,090
<i>What kind of strength
does this guy possess?</i>

1449
02:14:17,369 --> 02:14:18,633
<i>This doesn't look good...!</i>

1450
02:14:18,759 --> 02:14:23,055
<i>Naruto and I have both
completely exhaust our chakra!</i>

1451
02:14:26,433 --> 02:14:31,104
You will be killed by me!
I will not cease to exist!

1452
02:14:48,246 --> 02:14:49,246
Twenty!

1453
02:14:56,379 --> 02:14:58,090
Twenty-one!

1454
02:15:12,604 --> 02:15:16,066
<i>Leaf... Hurricane!</i>

1455
02:15:19,444 --> 02:15:21,530
How many did you take down Kakashi?

1456
02:15:21,905 --> 02:15:22,989
Twenty-two.

1457
02:15:24,157 --> 02:15:26,660
Huh, it seems I win again!

1458
02:15:28,787 --> 02:15:31,289
That was my twenty-third.

1459
02:15:31,373 --> 02:15:32,958
Yeah, yeah whatever...

1460
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:36,266
That try-hard attitude of yours
is what makes you cool!

1461
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:38,385
That's the reason you are my rival!

1462
02:15:39,606 --> 02:15:41,066
- Let's go!
- All right!

1463
02:15:52,144 --> 02:15:54,396
You're still grabbing my arm...

1464
02:15:54,561 --> 02:15:56,054
I can't use my jutsu this way...

1465
02:15:57,649 --> 02:16:00,735
Come on,
let go of me once and for all.

1466
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:16,126
I'm not letting your ambitions
interfere with the village... any longer...

1467
02:16:16,426 --> 02:16:21,514
There's no stopping my ambitions!
You will die here!

1468
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:24,259
You old fool...

1469
02:16:24,926 --> 02:16:26,928
As the Third Hokage,

1470
02:16:27,311 --> 02:16:31,815
are you saying you still have
the power to save this village?

1471
02:16:32,851 --> 02:16:37,272
Do you understand...
the current situation?!

1472
02:16:38,024 --> 02:16:41,866
Don't underestimate the shinobi
of this village!

1473
02:16:53,496 --> 02:16:56,208
We will not allow you to take
even one step beyond this point!

1474
02:17:12,506 --> 02:17:13,327
<i>Sakura!</i>

1475
02:17:14,407 --> 02:17:17,994
<i>Rescue Sakura,
even if it's the last thing you do!</i>

1476
02:17:18,772 --> 02:17:21,983
<i>I'll protect Sakura no matter what!</i>

1477
02:17:23,246 --> 02:17:23,950
<i>Please...</i>

1478
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:30,297
<i>Just a small amount is fine...</i>

1479
02:17:31,324 --> 02:17:32,086
<i>Give me...</i>

1480
02:17:37,717 --> 02:17:38,717
<i>Some chakra!</i>

1481
02:18:05,015 --> 02:18:07,392
What are you doing...?
There's only one opponent!

1482
02:18:19,596 --> 02:18:21,973
The Hyuga are the strongest clan
in the Leaf Village.

1483
02:18:22,294 --> 02:18:23,586
Don't forget that!

1484
02:18:27,173 --> 02:18:31,678
M-My... body... is immobilized...

1485
02:18:33,179 --> 02:18:35,015
Is this the first time
you're experiencing

1486
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,584
the Leaf's prized Shadow Possession Jutsu?

1487
02:18:37,934 --> 02:18:40,520
Well, take this too while I'm at it...

1488
02:18:41,563 --> 02:18:45,066
The Leaf's hidden technique...
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

1489
02:18:49,946 --> 02:18:51,531
<i>Expansion Jutsu!</i>

1490
02:18:58,872 --> 02:19:00,790
<i>Mind Destruction Jutsu!</i>

1491
02:19:05,503 --> 02:19:06,503
W-What's this?!

1492
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:09,007
My body is... all on its own...!

1493
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:10,395
S-Stop...

1494
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:12,051
Stop!

1495
02:19:19,237 --> 02:19:20,910
Reminds me of the old days!

1496
02:19:21,394 --> 02:19:22,273
Yeah!

1497
02:19:23,375 --> 02:19:26,002
The original
Ino-Shika-Cho trio reunites!

1498
02:19:31,624 --> 02:19:33,042
Kuromaru... let's go!

1499
02:19:33,239 --> 02:19:34,000
Right!

1500
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:36,868
In order to protect the village,

1501
02:19:36,975 --> 02:19:41,271
all Leaf shinobi are risking
their lives to fight.

1502
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:50,590
Real strength doesn't lie
in mastering all jutsu!

1503
02:19:53,093 --> 02:19:55,220
<i>The poison in my body is...</i>

1504
02:19:56,012 --> 02:19:59,099
Don't move, Shino.
I've sent in my Parasitic Insects.

1505
02:20:00,183 --> 02:20:01,434
They are removing the poison.

1506
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:03,394
Dad...

1507
02:20:05,605 --> 02:20:08,817
I believe I taught this
to you too, in the past...

1508
02:20:09,275 --> 02:20:11,611
It is when one protects
someone important...

1509
02:20:12,153 --> 02:20:15,990
that the true strength of
the shinobi will emerge!

1510
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:21,413
<i>I will protect everyone!</i>

1511
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:28,525
Here I come!
You stupid raccoon!

1512
02:20:28,628 --> 02:20:30,004
Die...!

1513
02:20:35,844 --> 02:20:36,844
Damn...

1514
02:20:38,555 --> 02:20:40,473
Damn it!

1515
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:09,794
D-Did he win?

1516
02:21:10,731 --> 02:21:12,524
<i>A simple headbutt...</i>

1517
02:21:12,847 --> 02:21:15,599
<i>His manner of fighting
is incredibly clumsy,</i>

1518
02:21:15,831 --> 02:21:19,710
<i>but to think he could squeeze out
that much chakra at such a critical stage.</i>

1519
02:21:20,571 --> 02:21:24,242
<i>I've never seen a knucklehead ninja
like him before, but...</i>

1520
02:21:24,329 --> 02:21:27,415
<i>he sure is the first phenomenal kid
I've seen in a long time.</i>

1521
02:21:28,905 --> 02:21:31,992
<i>It's too bad that I can't
see this through to the end,</i>

1522
02:21:32,901 --> 02:21:35,528
<i>but I've reached my limit.</i>

1523
02:21:35,987 --> 02:21:38,698
Gamakichi, let's head home!

1524
02:21:38,847 --> 02:21:40,301
Okay! Pop!

1525
02:21:57,217 --> 02:22:01,054
As expected, even I...
am empty now...

1526
02:22:02,889 --> 02:22:04,349
You are too, aren't you?

1527
02:22:05,225 --> 02:22:10,438
We're much alike...
Let this be our final battle!

1528
02:22:14,734 --> 02:22:15,777
It appears that...

1529
02:22:16,236 --> 02:22:23,576
I don't have the strength left
to yank out your entire soul.

1530
02:22:24,352 --> 02:22:27,939
However, your ambition ends here!

1531
02:22:28,172 --> 02:22:29,172
Not yet!

1532
02:22:29,681 --> 02:22:32,058
There's no stopping my ambition!

1533
02:22:32,561 --> 02:22:34,229
I have a suitable punishment for you

1534
02:22:34,254 --> 02:22:39,759
who has become addicted to jutsu,
and who has overindulged in jutsu!

1535
02:22:39,927 --> 02:22:43,639
I will seal away your ability
to use ninjutsu!

1536
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:44,764
What did you say?!

1537
02:22:53,898 --> 02:22:55,066
Don't tell me...?

1538
02:22:55,233 --> 02:22:57,151
Stop that!

1539
02:23:00,613 --> 02:23:02,031
<i>Seal!</i>

1540
02:23:11,541 --> 02:23:14,043
My... My arms...

1541
02:23:16,963 --> 02:23:20,592
Now... you can no longer use
either of your arms.

1542
02:23:21,342 --> 02:23:25,555
And since you can't use your arms,
you can't weave signs.

1543
02:23:26,139 --> 02:23:29,058
You can no longer perform any ninjutsu!

1544
02:23:29,309 --> 02:23:33,021
You old fool!
Give me back my arms!

1545
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,816
Orochimaru, you fool...

1546
02:23:37,525 --> 02:23:40,486
It's unfortunate that
we can't leave together,

1547
02:23:40,987 --> 02:23:42,488
but, my disciple...

1548
02:23:43,781 --> 02:23:46,576
We'll meet again in the next world.

1549
02:23:46,784 --> 02:23:48,886
You old fool...
whose life is hanging by a thread!

1550
02:23:48,911 --> 02:23:52,540
How dare you! 
How dare you seal away my jutsu!

1551
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:09,932
<i>In places where the Leaf dances,
a fire burns...</i>

1552
02:24:11,684 --> 02:24:14,356
<i>The fire's shadow
will illuminate the village...</i>

1553
02:24:31,663 --> 02:24:34,791
<i>And once more the Leaf will sprout...</i>

1554
02:25:01,317 --> 02:25:02,360
Sarutobi...

1555
02:25:03,437 --> 02:25:05,606
<i>At the very least this sword...</i>

1556
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:12,578
<i>It was a fitting end
for somebody like you</i>

1557
02:25:12,846 --> 02:25:15,890
<i>who mastered the Way of the Shinobi.</i>

1558
02:25:22,345 --> 02:25:25,414
It feels like my arms are burning...

1559
02:25:25,904 --> 02:25:27,000
Lord Orochimaru!

1560
02:25:27,961 --> 02:25:29,403
This is where we call off our plan.

1561
02:25:30,763 --> 02:25:33,391
Release the barrier.
We're heading back.

1562
02:25:33,891 --> 02:25:34,475
- Yes!
- Yes!

1563
02:25:34,892 --> 02:25:35,892
<i>- Release!
- Release!</i>

1564
02:25:44,026 --> 02:25:45,066
We won't let you get away!

1565
02:25:46,279 --> 02:25:48,573
<i>Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!</i>

1566
02:25:50,324 --> 02:25:53,006
<i>An adhesive type of string
filled with chakra...?</i>

1567
02:25:55,435 --> 02:25:58,104
Kakashi! They're on the move!
Do we go after them?

1568
02:25:58,220 --> 02:25:59,527
No, wait, Guy.

1569
02:26:00,084 --> 02:26:01,084
That's right...

1570
02:26:01,858 --> 02:26:04,964
If you make a move without
any data on the situation up there,

1571
02:26:05,544 --> 02:26:07,175
you will get caught in
the enemy's trap.

1572
02:26:07,866 --> 02:26:10,994
So... are you just going to watch?

1573
02:26:11,665 --> 02:26:12,337
Kabuto?

1574
02:26:16,392 --> 02:26:17,769
So you did know, after all.

1575
02:26:18,314 --> 02:26:19,535
So... what are we going to do?

1576
02:26:20,099 --> 02:26:21,619
It's time we retreated.

1577
02:26:22,309 --> 02:26:23,805
You're going to run away
from me again?

1578
02:26:25,181 --> 02:26:26,250
Right now...

1579
02:26:26,826 --> 02:26:30,705
if we show our cards,
they're most likely going to be copied.

1580
02:26:31,924 --> 02:26:33,342
Then again,

1581
02:26:33,443 --> 02:26:38,240
it doesn't seem like you've completely
mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.

1582
02:26:39,463 --> 02:26:40,160
Well then...

1583
02:26:51,272 --> 02:26:52,272
Temari...

1584
02:26:57,475 --> 02:26:58,475
Kankuro!

1585
02:27:17,677 --> 02:27:18,911
I'm leaving Sakura with you.

1586
02:27:31,636 --> 02:27:35,472
<i>Why is... this guy so strong?</i>

1587
02:27:50,854 --> 02:27:53,208
<i>I told you not to talk to that guy!</i>

1588
02:27:53,492 --> 02:27:54,492
<i>Let's go.</i>

1589
02:27:59,346 --> 02:28:02,022
<i>Oh, there! That's him...</i>

1590
02:28:04,488 --> 02:28:05,488
<i>Go away!</i>

1591
02:28:08,254 --> 02:28:14,218
<i>Monster! Monster! Monster...!</i>

1592
02:28:23,728 --> 02:28:25,479
<i>You monster! Die!</i>

1593
02:28:28,399 --> 02:28:31,360
<i>That's him... Don't get involved, fool!</i>

1594
02:28:34,921 --> 02:28:36,256
<i>Don't look at him!</i>

1595
02:28:39,374 --> 02:28:40,541
<i>Go away!</i>

1596
02:29:04,775 --> 02:29:08,237
<i>To them, I'm just an unwanted monster
they want to see disappear.</i>

1597
02:29:08,606 --> 02:29:13,235
<i>So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?</i>

1598
02:29:16,183 --> 02:29:21,397
<i>And at that moment,
I knew what I was.</i>

1599
02:29:22,654 --> 02:29:26,116
<i>That I...</i>

1600
02:29:28,025 --> 02:29:33,614
<i>that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.</i>

1601
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:36,612
D-Don't come any closer!

1602
02:29:44,892 --> 02:29:51,148
Being all alone... That pain
is unbearable, isn't it?

1603
02:29:54,662 --> 02:29:56,330
I know how you feel...

1604
02:29:56,925 --> 02:30:00,345
I don't know why, but I understand
the pain in your heart so well.

1605
02:30:01,283 --> 02:30:06,288
But now... I have people who are
precious to me.

1606
02:30:09,458 --> 02:30:14,255
And I won't let those important people...
get hurt!

1607
02:30:16,021 --> 02:30:22,444
I will stop you... even if it means
I have to kill you!

1608
02:30:23,159 --> 02:30:24,159
Why...?

1609
02:30:25,333 --> 02:30:28,503
How can you...
fight so hard for other people?

1610
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:33,190
They saved me from the hell
of being all alone.

1611
02:30:33,826 --> 02:30:36,120
They accepted me... for who I am.

1612
02:30:37,619 --> 02:30:40,772
That's why...
they're so important to me!

1613
02:30:48,002 --> 02:30:52,673
<i>Love is the desire to serve
someone precious to you,</i>

1614
02:30:52,953 --> 02:30:55,397
<i>to cherish them and watch over them...</i>

1615
02:30:56,964 --> 02:30:58,466
Love...

1616
02:31:00,326 --> 02:31:02,870
<i>That is why he's so strong?</i>

1617
02:31:05,342 --> 02:31:06,761
That's enough, Naruto...

1618
02:31:11,437 --> 02:31:12,813
Sakura is okay.

1619
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:16,192
This guy's chakra must
be depleted as well...

1620
02:31:17,546 --> 02:31:19,626
The sand around Sakura
crumbled away a long time ago.

1621
02:31:20,315 --> 02:31:22,031
Oh, I see...

1622
02:31:29,225 --> 02:31:32,478
I've had enough... Let's stop this.

1623
02:31:32,812 --> 02:31:33,708
Gaara?

1624
02:31:35,873 --> 02:31:39,465
<i>I've never seen Gaara in such
a weakened state before...</i>

1625
02:31:40,955 --> 02:31:41,967
All right.

1626
02:32:02,447 --> 02:32:04,825
<i>Naruto Uzumaki, huh?</i>

1627
02:32:07,541 --> 02:32:10,085
<i>One of these days, even I...</i>

1628
02:32:13,624 --> 02:32:15,709
Temari... Kankuro...

1629
02:32:16,265 --> 02:32:16,876
- Huh?
- Huh?

1630
02:32:18,045 --> 02:32:19,045
Sorry...

1631
02:32:23,676 --> 02:32:25,636
D-Don't worry about it...

1632
02:33:30,951 --> 02:33:32,036
Rain...

1633
02:33:33,037 --> 02:33:34,747
The sky has started to weep as well...

1634
02:33:37,459 --> 02:33:39,086
We will begin the memorial service

1635
02:33:39,143 --> 02:33:41,645
for the Third Hokage,
who lost his life in this battle,

1636
02:33:41,927 --> 02:33:46,474
as well as the other victims
of this attack.

1637
02:34:06,127 --> 02:34:07,378
<i>Why?</i>

1638
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:12,111
<i>Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?</i>

1639
02:34:21,523 --> 02:34:22,314
<i>Why...?</i>

1640
02:34:46,288 --> 02:34:47,414
For Hayate?

1641
02:34:52,788 --> 02:34:56,166
The Third Hokage's funeral
has already started. Make it quick.

1642
02:34:57,496 --> 02:35:00,624
You too, Kakashi.
You here for Obito...?

1643
02:35:02,441 --> 02:35:05,110
If you're always thinking of
an excuse for your tardiness,

1644
02:35:05,801 --> 02:35:07,551
you should just come earlier.

1645
02:35:12,052 --> 02:35:14,263
I do...
I've been here since the morning.

1646
02:35:17,448 --> 02:35:19,492
It's just that,
whenever I come here

1647
02:35:19,518 --> 02:35:23,564
I want to punish myself
for being such a fool in the past.

1648
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,581
There are two bells.

1649
02:35:32,899 --> 02:35:34,561
The fact that there are
only two means...?

1650
02:35:35,075 --> 02:35:37,036
That one of us has to go
to the tree trunk...

1651
02:35:37,578 --> 02:35:39,872
You're quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.

1652
02:35:40,372 --> 02:35:42,875
All right! I'll make it!

1653
02:35:44,012 --> 02:35:46,155
Come at me with the intent to kill!

1654
02:35:58,724 --> 02:36:01,573
Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn't I?

1655
02:36:02,311 --> 02:36:04,201
You got tied to the tree trunk,
after all.

1656
02:36:04,288 --> 02:36:05,237
Shut up!

1657
02:36:05,506 --> 02:36:07,511
You're as flat as a cutting board.

1658
02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:10,986
What did you say?! You closet perv!

1659
02:36:12,321 --> 02:36:15,157
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1660
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:17,076
Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!

1661
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:18,160
Okay!

1662
02:36:30,172 --> 02:36:31,918
You are hopeless...

1663
02:36:32,695 --> 02:36:36,783
Ninja shouldn't be getting caught in
obvious traps like that over and over again.

1664
02:36:37,082 --> 02:36:37,942
But...

1665
02:36:38,282 --> 02:36:40,451
Why don't you learn a little
from Orochimaru?!

1666
02:36:41,537 --> 02:36:45,249
Sarutobi-sensei, you're always
saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!

1667
02:36:45,708 --> 02:36:46,339
Hm?

1668
02:36:46,953 --> 02:36:50,563
When it comes to snooping,
I'm great at Transparency Jutsu.

1669
02:36:51,947 --> 02:36:52,920
Gimme a break...

1670
02:36:53,166 --> 02:36:54,918
I don't even wanna know

1671
02:36:54,943 --> 02:36:56,254
what level of Transparency Jutsu
you possess...

1672
02:36:56,365 --> 02:36:59,564
I've never been caught once!
And that's the truth!

1673
02:37:01,398 --> 02:37:06,484
If you're that sure of yourself,
I'll go with you next time...

1674
02:37:10,546 --> 02:37:12,351
You're such a perv, Sarutobi-sensei...

1675
02:37:27,146 --> 02:37:28,605
Iruka-sensei...

1676
02:37:28,689 --> 02:37:29,689
Hmm?

1677
02:37:30,718 --> 02:37:35,040
Why do people risk their own lives
for other people?

1678
02:37:38,989 --> 02:37:42,158
When one person dies...

1679
02:37:43,894 --> 02:37:47,813
their past, present, and future
disappear along with them.

1680
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:52,087
Many people die fulfilling
their duty in battle...

1681
02:37:52,754 --> 02:37:56,258
And all too easily.

1682
02:37:58,189 --> 02:38:00,066
Hayate was one of them.

1683
02:38:01,096 --> 02:38:04,641
Those who pass away also
have dreams and ambitions.

1684
02:38:05,767 --> 02:38:10,189
But everyone has something else,
just as important.

1685
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:17,946
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers...
Those who are dear to them.

1686
02:38:19,422 --> 02:38:21,549
They trust each other
and help each other,

1687
02:38:22,191 --> 02:38:26,538
the people they've cherished
since the day they were born.

1688
02:38:27,956 --> 02:38:30,501
And that bond that connects people

1689
02:38:30,895 --> 02:38:34,296
becomes stronger and
thicker as time goes by...

1690
02:38:35,923 --> 02:38:37,466
It can't be explained by logic...

1691
02:38:38,287 --> 02:38:43,688
Those who hold those strings just do it,
because it's important to them.

1692
02:38:45,254 --> 02:38:49,197
Yeah, I kind of get it.

1693
02:38:50,248 --> 02:38:50,902
But...

1694
02:38:53,941 --> 02:38:55,484
It's tough to die.

1695
02:38:56,921 --> 02:38:59,424
It's not like he died for nothing.

1696
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:03,158
He left us something very important.

1697
02:39:04,607 --> 02:39:07,535
Well, you'll eventually understand
one of these days.

1698
02:39:08,277 --> 02:39:11,614
Yeah, I kind of get that too!

1699
02:39:21,728 --> 02:39:23,614
Bye! Iruka-sensei!

1700
02:39:23,899 --> 02:39:24,607
Yeah...

1701
02:39:26,967 --> 02:39:30,695
<i>Lord Third Hokage,
the Will of Fire you spoke of...</i>

1702
02:39:31,573 --> 02:39:36,024
<i>seems to have been passed on
to the young Leaves.</i>

1703
02:39:37,985 --> 02:39:41,233
<i>The flame that you lit
in their hearts,</i>

1704
02:39:41,762 --> 02:39:45,019
<i>will burn bright and strong...</i>

1705
02:39:45,615 --> 02:39:49,404
<i>And it will shine upon this village,
and watch over and protect us.</i>

1706
02:39:54,935 --> 02:39:59,606
<i>He'll become Hokage... one day</i>
