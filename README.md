# Rebuild of Naruto - Subtitle Enhancement

This repository provides **enhanced English subtitles** specifically tailored for the fan-made *Rebuild of Naruto* edit.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **not affiliated with or responsible for the Rebuild of Naruto fan edit itself**. It solely aims to improve subtitle quality and syncing for those watching the Rebuild version.

---

## Project Purpose

The original *Rebuild of Naruto* is a fan-created reedit of the Naruto anime, offering a more streamlined and coherent viewing experience. However, subtitle timing and translation quality can vary.  
This project offers:

- **Improved English subtitles** with better grammar, timing, and readability.
- Subtitles synced to the **Rebuild-specific cuts**, not the original Naruto episodes.
- Consistent, player-friendly filename formatting.

---

## Subtitle Naming Convention

Subtitle files follow a consistent naming structure to match the Rebuild episodes:

```
Rebuild of Naruto - S01E01 - Academy Days [1080p][4x3][AV1].eng.srt
```


## File Naming Note

Depending on your media player's expectations or your filename preferences, you may need to **rename the subtitle files** to match your local video filenames for proper syncing. Tools like [FileBot](https://www.filebot.net/) or manual renaming can help with this.
